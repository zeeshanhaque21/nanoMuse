# Contributing

Use nanoMuse for a real task, report what broke, then pick something focused. Issues and pull requests are welcome; for anything larger than a fix, open an issue first so we can agree on the shape. [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) says where help is wanted and where to start in each area. For a quick question or to talk through an idea before writing it up, there is a [Discord](https://discord.gg/bkTySmm28X); decisions still land in issues and pull requests, where they can be found later.

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the short version of this file for coding agents and for people in a hurry: the layout, the check commands per area, and the conventions below in one screen. The two must agree; when they do not, fix both.

## Two trees

- **`android/`** — the phone apps. A modified copy of [OpenMinis](https://github.com/OpenMinis/OpenMinis) 1.13 imported with `git subtree` (GPL-3.0): the Android app under `android/src/android`, the iOS app under `android/src/ios`. Upstream's rules apply here (below), so that the subtree stays pullable.
- **Everything else is ours** — the Python runtime (`nanomuse/`), the relay (`cloud/`), the web console (`web/`), the desktop app (`harness/dsh-nanomuse/` and the Electron shell in `harness/desktop/`), the showcase (`demo/`), the docs (`docs/`, served by `website/`) and the scripts. One set of conventions, the ones in this file; [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) has the check command for each area and [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) explains how the pieces fit. [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) says which version brought what and where help is wanted.

## Licence and sign-off

nanoMuse is **GPL-3.0-or-later** ([LICENSE](LICENSE), [NOTICE](NOTICE)). By contributing you agree that your contribution is licensed the same way. Every commit must carry a [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org) sign-off — `git commit -s` adds the line:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

CI checks it. Not accepted, ever:

- code under a licence that cannot be combined with GPL-3.0 (GPL-2.0-*only*, SSPL, BUSL, "source-available", proprietary SDKs);
- anything obtained by decompiling, unpacking or scraping the Meta Muse app, or the OpenMinis binaries beyond what their source already shows;
- the OpenMinis or Meta Muse names and logos as part of nanoMuse's own identity (attribution in the About screen and NOTICE is required and stays).

## Working in `android/`

Upstream is a mirror of a private tree, squashed roughly monthly, and does not take pull requests. We have to be able to `git subtree pull` each release, so:

1. **Do not rename the Kotlin package** `com.openminis.app` or the Gradle `namespace`. Only the `applicationId` (`io.github.nanomuse.app`) is ours.
2. **Do not rename sandbox paths or CLI names** inside the root file system (`/var/minis`, `minis-global`, `minis-open`, `minis-mcp-cli`, `android-*`). They are upstream's contract with itself.
3. **New code goes in new files** — package `io.github.nanomuse.*` or a new file next to the upstream one. When an upstream file must change, add a `// nanoMuse:` comment at the spot, and make one change per spot.
4. **Rebranding is a script, not hand edits.** `scripts/rebrand.py` (names, ids, colours, links — Android and iOS), `scripts/gen-android-icons.py` and `scripts/gen-ios-icons.py` (icons) are idempotent; run them after every upstream pull. Do not fix a rebranding miss by hand — fix the script.
5. **Binary resources** (icon PNGs) are overwritten under the upstream name; on a pull conflict take ours (`git checkout --ours`).
6. **iOS follows the same rules.** The iOS half of upstream lives at `android/src/ios` (see [docs/ios.md](docs/ios.md)); our Swift goes in `android/src/ios/NanoMuse/`, an edit inside an upstream Swift file carries a `// nanoMuse:` comment.

Build steps are in [android/BUILDING.md](android/BUILDING.md) (upstream) and, for the toolchain this repository is built with, in `scripts/android/` — JDK 21, SDK CMake 3.22.1, NDK r27c, Go 1.25+, `gomobile`; `deps/build_proot.sh` builds proot from the `android/deps/proot` submodule (our fork; portable `awk`, no gawk needed) and must run before `scripts/prepare_android_sandbox.sh`.

### Pulling an upstream release

```bash
git fetch openminis --tags
git subtree pull --prefix=android openminis 1.14 -m "Merge OpenMinis 1.14"
git checkout --ours -- 'android/src/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*' \
    'android/src/ios/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset' 'android/src/ios/Resources/AlternateIcons'
python scripts/rebrand.py && python scripts/gen-android-icons.py && python scripts/gen-ios-icons.py
# resolve the remaining conflicts at the `// nanoMuse:` marks, build, run the smoke list
```

## Working in the runtime, the relay and the web console

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeeshanhaque21/nanoMuse.git && cd nanoMuse
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"            # add ",browser" for the Playwright tool
nanomuse config init                  # config/config.toml is git-ignored
```

Before you push:

```bash
ruff check nanomuse tests scripts && ruff format nanomuse tests scripts
mypy                                           # types; config in pyproject.toml
python -m pytest -q                            # MockLLM only, no network
cd web && npm run check && npm run build       # if you touched web/; commit the build
cd cloud && pip install -e ".[dev]" && ruff check . && pytest   # if you touched the relay
```

The desktop app, the Electron shell and the docs site have their own lines in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Guidelines that apply everywhere: everything that acts goes through the Sentinel with an honest `risk`; secrets never reach the model (`{{vault:NAME}}`); test with `MockLLM`; no internal endpoints or keys in the repo; Ruff, line length 100, type hints; docs are part of the change.

## Every string in every language

nanoMuse is used in more than one country, so a user-visible string is never added in one language. Write it in English first, then in 简体中文, then in every other locale the file already has — `res/values-*/nm_strings.xml` on Android (keys start with `nm_`; upstream's `strings.xml` is not ours to edit), `Localizable.xcstrings` on iOS, `en` and `zh` in `harness/dsh-nanomuse/src/client/locales.ts` on the desktop, the console and e-mail templates in `cloud/`. Dates, numbers and currency use the person's locale. Do not assume a +86 phone number, a Chinese app or Beijing time: SMS codes reach mainland-China numbers only, so a sign-in screen says that and offers e-mail. The voice is the same in every language — plain, specific, no marketing words, no exclamation marks — and Meta's own UI text is never copied verbatim.

## Translating the docs

The docs site (nanomuse.cn/docs, built by `website/` from `docs/`) is in English and 简体中文. The Chinese pages live in `docs/zh/` with the **same file names** as the English ones — `docs/zh/android.md` is the twin of `docs/android.md` — and `website/.vitepress/config.mts` holds the Chinese nav and sidebar. A change to an English page updates its Chinese twin in the same pull request; a new English page gets a Chinese page and a line in both sidebars. `cd website && npm run docs:build` is the dead-link check for both languages.

Rules for a Chinese page:

- Facts are identical to the English page: version numbers, paths, commands, config keys, URLs, code blocks, table shapes and link targets. Nothing is added, softened or inflated.
- Every heading below the title keeps the English anchor: `## 安装 {#install}`. Links between pages (`android.md`, `configuration.md#connectors`) then work in both languages, and so do the sidebar's anchors.
- Paths: pages link to pages by bare name (`android.md`); images and other files under `docs/` are one level up (`../screenshots/feed.png`); the repository is two levels up (`../../nanomuse/config.py`).
- Voice as everywhere else: plain, specific, human; Chinese idiom, never a word-for-word rendering of the English sentence; no exclamation marks, no marketing words. Second person 你, the agent is 它; menu paths as 设置 → 账号 → 设备, button and switch names in 「」.
- Things are called what the apps' Chinese screens call them. The glossary below is derived from `res/values-zh/nm_strings.xml`, the `zh` block of `locales.ts`, `Localizable.xcstrings` (zh-Hans), `web/src/i18n/zh-CN.ts` and the relay console; when a screen and the glossary disagree, the screen wins and the glossary is corrected.

## Commits and pull requests

- The subject line follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org): `type(scope): what changed`, in the imperative, no full stop — `feat(android): hands capsule shows the model's thought`, `fix(relay): keep the face a device drew when another renames`, `docs(readme): move the translations to docs/readme/`, `test(gateway): sighted model for the operator lane`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`; the scope is the part of the tree (`runtime`, `android`, `web`, `desktop`, `relay`, `showcase`, `mobilegym`, `harness`, `docs`, `deps`…). The body says why, in plain words. The *Commits* check on a pull request fails on a subject that does not fit; merge commits are exempt.
- One pull request, one topic. Screenshots for anything visible in the app.
- Say which device and Android version you tested on. Phone-side features are tested on real hardware; the emulator is x86_64 and cannot run the arm64 APK.
- `main` is protected. Code lands through a pull request, and the merge waits for four checks: the Python runtime on Ubuntu / Python 3.12, the web app build, the Android debug APK, and the DCO sign-off. Each workflow first works out which tree the change touched and skips the jobs that do not apply, so a docs-only pull request is not held up by a build it never needed. The rest of the matrix (other Python versions, macOS, Windows) runs and shows up, but does not gate the merge; the Python runtime's Windows job is marked experimental (its shell tool assumes a POSIX shell) and cannot fail the build — the Windows desktop app is built and released by its own workflow and is supported. GitHub runs no `pull_request` workflow at all while the branch conflicts with `main` (`gh pr checks` says "no checks reported", and it stays that way), so a pull request that shows no checks needs a rebase on `main` first, not a longer wait.
- Merges are **rebase** or **merge commit**, never squash: the `Signed-off-by` on each commit is the record, and squashing would drop it. A merge commit is also what `git subtree pull` needs for the `android/` tree.
- Maintainers work the same way: one branch and one pull request per version (`0.1.39`, `0.1.40`, …), merged when green, tagged and released from `main` (the recipe is below). Documentation and copy — READMEs, `docs/`, release notes — may go straight to `main`.
- Dependabot opens its pull requests once a month, grouped; they are merged when the checks are green, and a bump that changes the committed web bundle gets its rebuild right after.

## Releasing (maintainers)

A version is a plain number — `0.1.39`, `0.1.40`, … — because the apps' update check compares them; each release also carries a one-word English codename (Foundation, Identity, Home, … Keys, Clear; `CHANGELOG.md` has the list) and its title is `nanoMuse <version> · <Codename>`. The apps, the runtime, the web console and the desktop app share one version; the relay has its own (`cloud/pyproject.toml`) and moves only when it changed. Versions move in the release commit and nowhere else.

1. **The release commit** `build(release): <version> <Codename>`, on its own branch and pull request. `scripts/release-bump.sh <old> <new> <old-code> <new-code> [<relay-old> <relay-new>]` moves every version file (`pyproject.toml`, `nanomuse/__init__.py`, `CITATION.cff`, `web/package.json`, the two `harness/*/package.json` and their lock files, the relay console's `VERSION`, the `VERSION_NAME`/`VERSION_CODE` in `scripts/rebrand.py`); then `python scripts/rebrand.py` writes the Android `versionName`/`versionCode` and the iOS `MARKETING_VERSION` (a second run must print `clean`). `scripts/release-docs.py <old> <new> <OldName> <NewName> <date>` opens the version's block in `CHANGELOG.md` under *Unreleased* and moves the download links of `README.md`, `docs/readme/*` and `docs/index.md` to the new tag. By hand: the lead paragraph of the `CHANGELOG.md` block and the empty `### Cloud / Runtime / Web / Desktop / Android / iOS / Project` headings for the next *Unreleased*; `docs/releases/v<version>.md` from [docs/release-notes-template.md](docs/release-notes-template.md) — a short story, *Highlights*, *Upgrade Notes*, *Community*, English first and the same in Chinese in a collapsed block, every link checked; the *News* list of the ten READMEs (one short line per milestone, the date in inline code: milestones such as the paper and the first release stay, only the line that names the latest version is replaced by the new one); the past-releases row in `docs/roadmap.md`; any "next release" cell in `docs/parity.md`. Run the checks for what changed ([AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); `scripts/rebrand.py` → `clean`, `connectors-json.mjs --check`, `providers-json.mjs --check`, `cd website && npm run docs:build`), and the *iOS · build check* workflow on the branch. Merge when green; `M` is the merge commit.
2. **The APK and the GitHub release.** `scripts/release-apk.sh <version>` at `M` builds the release APK, verifies the signature and writes the sha256; `scripts/release-apk.sh <version> --publish-only --target M` tags `v<version>` on `M` and creates the release (marked Latest; `--prerelease` for one that is not) with `docs/releases/v<version>.md` as the body. *What's Changed*, *New Contributors*, *Contributors* and the *Full Changelog* link are filled in from the pull requests merged since the previous tag by `scripts/release_notes.py` (`scripts/release_notes.py <version>` shows the body it would publish). The tag starts the desktop, harness, Docker and test workflows; the desktop installers, their `SHA256SUMS-desktop.txt`, the harness tarball and its `SHA256SUMS-harness.txt` are attached to the release by CI as they finish, the Docker image lands on `ghcr.io/nano-muse/nanomuse` as `<version>`, `<major.minor>` and `latest`. Every workflow must end green before the release is announced. The signing key is one key for every version so an update installs over the previous one; it is not in the repository and not in CI.
3. **The relay**, when its version moved: `cloud/deploy/nanomuse-hk/deploy.sh` from the checkout at `M`; `/healthz` must answer with the new version.
4. **TestFlight.** The *iOS · TestFlight* workflow on `main` (or a tag `ios-*`) uploads the build; its number is the run number. Once App Store Connect shows it processed, the external group gets it after Apple's beta review; `docs/releases/v<version>.md` names the build number. [docs/ios.md](docs/ios.md) has the details.
5. **The docs site and the homepage** ([nano-muse/nano-muse.github.io](https://github.com/nano-muse/nano-muse.github.io), live at nanomuse.cn within a minute of a push to `main`): `cd website && DOCS_BASE=/docs/ npm run docs:build` and copy `.vitepress/dist/` to the site's `docs/`; in `index.html` the version line (both languages), every download link and the `nanomuse.cn/dl/v<version>/` mirror link, the Docker tag, and the *News* list: the same lines as the README's, only the latest-version line is replaced, in both languages. The download mirror itself fills in on its own within fifteen minutes of the release.

A release that is only a docs fix goes straight to `main`; a release note that turned out wrong (a build number, a link) is fixed by a small pull request, never by rewriting history.
