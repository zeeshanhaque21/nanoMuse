# Contributing

Use nanoMuse for a real task, report what broke, then pick something focused. Issues and pull requests are welcome; for anything larger than a fix, open an issue first so we can agree on the shape.

## Two trees

- **`android/`** — the app. A modified copy of [OpenMinis](https://github.com/OpenMinis/OpenMinis) 1.13 imported with `git subtree` (GPL-3.0). This is where the work happens now; see [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for what defines the project and which version brings what.
- **`nanomuse/`, `web/`, `demo/`, `site/`** — the Python line (agent, Sentinel, web app, showcase). Frozen at tag `pre-openminis`; kept as the base of the desktop and web front doors and as the design record for the screen as a hand. Fixes are welcome, features wait.

## Licence and sign-off

nanoMuse is **GPL-3.0-or-later** ([LICENSE](LICENSE), [NOTICE](NOTICE)). By contributing you agree that your contribution is licensed the same way. Every commit must carry a [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org) sign-off — `git commit -s` adds the line:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

CI checks it. Not accepted, ever:

- code under a licence that cannot be combined with GPL-3.0 (GPL-2.0-*only*, SSPL, BUSL, "source-available", proprietary SDKs);
- anything obtained by decompiling, unpacking or scraping the Meta Muse app, or the OpenMinis binaries beyond what their source already shows;
- the OpenMinis or Meta Muse names and logos as part of nanoMuse's own identity (attribution in the About screen and NOTICE is required and stays).

## Working in `android/`

Upstream is a mirror of a private tree, squashed roughly monthly, and does not take pull requests. We have to be able to `git subtree pull` each release, so:

1. **Do not rename the Kotlin package** `com.openminis.app` or the Gradle `namespace`. Only the `applicationId` (`io.github.nanomuse.app`) is ours.
2. **Do not rename sandbox paths or CLI names** inside the root file system (`/var/minis`, `minis-global`, `minis-open`, `minis-mcp-cli`, `android-*`). They are upstream's contract with itself.
3. **New code goes in new files** — package `io.github.nanomuse.*` or a new file next to the upstream one. When an upstream file must change, add a `// nanoMuse:` comment at the spot, and make one change per spot.
4. **Rebranding is a script, not hand edits.** `scripts/rebrand.py` (names, ids, colours, links — Android and iOS), `scripts/gen-android-icons.py` and `scripts/gen-ios-icons.py` (icons) are idempotent; run them after every upstream pull. Do not fix a rebranding miss by hand — fix the script.
5. **Binary resources** (icon PNGs) are overwritten under the upstream name; on a pull conflict take ours (`git checkout --ours`).
6. **iOS follows the same rules.** The iOS half of upstream lives at `android/src/ios` (see [docs/ios.md](docs/ios.md)); our Swift goes in `android/src/ios/NanoMuse/`, an edit inside an upstream Swift file carries a `// nanoMuse:` comment.

Build steps are in [android/BUILDING.md](android/BUILDING.md) (upstream) and, for the toolchain this repository is built with, in `scripts/android/` — JDK 21, SDK CMake 3.22.1, NDK r27c, Go 1.25+, `gomobile`; `deps/build_proot.sh` builds proot from the `android/deps/proot` submodule (our fork; portable `awk`, no gawk needed) and must run before `scripts/prepare_android_sandbox.sh`.

### Pulling an upstream release

```bash
git fetch openminis --tags
git subtree pull --prefix=android openminis 1.14 -m "Merge OpenMinis 1.14"
git checkout --ours -- 'android/src/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*' \
    'android/src/ios/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset' 'android/src/ios/Resources/AlternateIcons'
python scripts/rebrand.py && python scripts/gen-android-icons.py && python scripts/gen-ios-icons.py
# resolve the remaining conflicts at the `// nanoMuse:` marks, build, run the smoke list
```

## Working in the Python line

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse.git && cd nanoMuse
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"            # add ",browser" for the Playwright tool
nanomuse config init                  # config/config.toml is git-ignored
```

Before you push:

```bash
ruff check nanomuse tests scripts && ruff format nanomuse tests scripts
mypy                                           # types; config in pyproject.toml
python -m pytest -q                            # MockLLM only, no network
cd web && npm run check && npm run build       # if you touched web/; commit the build
```

Guidelines that still apply there: everything that acts goes through the Sentinel with an honest `risk`; secrets never reach the model (`{{vault:NAME}}`); test with `MockLLM`; no internal endpoints or keys in the repo; Ruff, line length 100, type hints; docs are part of the change.

## Commits and pull requests

- The subject line follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org): `type(scope): what changed`, in the imperative, no full stop — `feat(android): hands capsule shows the model's thought`, `fix(relay): keep the face a device drew when another renames`, `docs(readme): move the translations to docs/readme/`, `test(gateway): sighted model for the operator lane`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`; the scope is the part of the tree (`runtime`, `android`, `web`, `desktop`, `relay`, `showcase`, `mobilegym`, `harness`, `docs`, `deps`…). The body says why, in plain words. The *Commits* check on a pull request fails on a subject that does not fit; merge commits are exempt.
- One pull request, one topic. Screenshots for anything visible in the app.
- Say which device and Android version you tested on. Phone-side features are tested on real hardware; the emulator is x86_64 and cannot run the arm64 APK.
- `main` is protected. Code lands through a pull request, and the merge waits for four checks: the Python line on Ubuntu / Python 3.12, the web app build, the Android debug APK, and the DCO sign-off. Each workflow first works out which tree the change touched and skips the jobs that do not apply, so a docs-only pull request is not held up by a build it never needed. The rest of the matrix (other Python versions, macOS, Windows) runs and shows up, but does not gate the merge; Windows is not a supported platform yet and cannot fail the build.
- Merges are **rebase** or **merge commit**, never squash: the `Signed-off-by` on each commit is the record, and squashing would drop it. A merge commit is also what `git subtree pull` needs for the `android/` tree.
- Maintainers work the same way: one branch and one pull request per version (`0.1.12`, `0.1.13`, …), merged when green, tagged and released from `main`. Documentation and copy — READMEs, `docs/`, release notes — may go straight to `main`.
- Dependabot opens its pull requests once a month, grouped; they are merged when the checks are green, and a bump that changes the committed web bundle gets its rebuild right after.

## Releasing (maintainers)

Every stage of Phase 1 is a version — `0.1.1`, `0.1.2`, … `0.1.9`, then `0.2.0`. Version names stay plain numbers (the in-app update check compares them); each release also carries a one-word English codename (Foundation, Identity, Home, … Union, Steps; `CHANGELOG.md` has the list), and the release title is `nanoMuse <version> · <Codename>`. `scripts/release-apk.sh <version>` builds the release APK, verifies the signature, writes the sha256 and creates the GitHub release (marked Latest; `--prerelease` for one that is not) with `docs/releases/v<version>.md` as the notes — a short story, *Highlights*, *Upgrade Notes* and *Community* in English first, the same notes in Chinese in a collapsed block at the end; `docs/release-notes-template.md` is the shape. *What's Changed*, *New Contributors*, *Contributors* and the *Full Changelog* link are filled in from the pull requests merged since the previous tag by `scripts/release_notes.py` when the release is published (`scripts/release_notes.py <version>` shows the body it would publish). The signing key is one key for every version so an update installs over the previous one; it is not in the repository and not in CI.
