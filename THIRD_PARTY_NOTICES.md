# Third-party notices

nanoMuse is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later ([LICENSE](LICENSE), [NOTICE](NOTICE)). It stands on other people's work; this file says whose, and on what terms. Three lists: what the Android app is built from, what the frozen Python line includes, and projects we learned from without taking code.

## The Android app (`android/`)

### OpenMinis — GPL-3.0

The app is a modified copy of [OpenMinis](https://github.com/OpenMinis/OpenMinis) 1.13 (tag `1.13`, commit `4ef2900`), Copyright (C) the OpenMinis authors, imported with `git subtree` so that its history is in ours. Modifications since 2026-09-24 are recorded in `git log -- android/`, and every edit inside an upstream file carries a `// nanoMuse:` comment. The OpenMinis name and logo are theirs and are not used for this application. What follows is OpenMinis's own third-party list, kept to the parts that remain in this tree (the iOS half was removed).

### Native code (`android/deps/`)

| [proot](https://github.com/nano-muse/proot) | git submodule `android/deps/proot` — our fork of [OpenMinis/proot](https://github.com/OpenMinis/proot), itself a fork of [termux/proot](https://github.com/termux/proot) | **GPL-2.0** | The Linux sandbox. Runs as a separate program (`assets/proot-aarch64`; also shipped as `lib/arm64-v8a/libproot.so` and the two loaders so the installer places them where Android lets them execute). Built by `android/deps/build_proot.sh`. |

### Bundled assets

| Asset | Location | License |
|---|---|---|
| KaTeX | `app/src/main/assets/katex/` | **MIT** |
| jieba dictionaries | `app/src/main/assets/jieba/` | **MIT** (cppjieba distribution) |

### The nanoMuse mark

The name nanoMuse and the mark in `assets/brand/` are the project's own. Use them to refer to this project; do not use them to suggest that something else is nanoMuse or endorsed by it.

## The Python line (`nanomuse/`, `web/`, `demo/`, `site/`)

Frozen since the OpenMinis import (tag `pre-openminis`), kept as the base of the later web and desktop phases. Third-party code inside it keeps its own licence and notice.

### MemGUI-Bench — MIT

The phone operator (`nanomuse/phone/operator.py`) is a port of the `mobile_use` operator in [MemGUI-Bench](https://github.com/lgy0404/MemGUI-Bench) (`src/mobile_world/agents/implementations/qwen3vl.py` and its prompt): the tool schema, the system prompt's wording, the `Thought` / `Action` / `<tool_call>` reply shape, the 999-grid coordinates and the step history. Rewritten in nanoMuse's own structure, with rules added (passwords, payments, `ask_user`), Sentinel labels and traces.

### MobileGym — Apache-2.0 (code), CC BY-NC 4.0 (data)

[MobileGym](https://github.com/Purewhiter/mobilegym) is the simulated Android phone the showcase runs on. `demo/mobilegym/apps/nanoMuse/` is an app module written for it; `demo/mobilegym/install.sh` copies the module into a MobileGym checkout and the showcase image (`demo/showcase/caddy/Dockerfile`) builds MobileGym with it. MobileGym's code is Apache-2.0; its default app data (`mobilegym-data`: synthetic and sanitised content, icons) is [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), **non-commercial use only** — the hosted showcase serves it as a free demonstration and nothing else. The finger overlay in `gui.ts` follows MobileGym's own touch-feedback timing.

### modern-screenshot — MIT

The showcase's in-page screenshots use [modern-screenshot](https://github.com/qq15725/modern-screenshot) (Copyright (c) 2021-present wxm), pulled in at build time by `install.sh`.

### Caddy modules — Apache-2.0

The showcase's Caddy is built with [caddy-dns/cloudflare](https://github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare) (DNS-01 certificates) and [WeidiDeng/caddy-cloudflare-ip](https://github.com/WeidiDeng/caddy-cloudflare-ip) (trusted proxy ranges), both Apache-2.0, like [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy) itself.

### Figtree — SIL Open Font License 1.1

The web app's typeface, [Figtree](https://github.com/erikdkennedy/figtree) by Erik Kennedy, ships in `web/public/fonts/` under the OFL (`web/public/fonts/OFL.txt`).

### nanobot — MIT

The Feishu channel's WebSocket runner (`nanomuse/channels/feishu.py`, class `_Runner`) follows the shape of `FeishuWsRunner` in [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot) (Copyright (c) 2025 HKUDS): the SDK's client on a thread with its own event loop, swapping the module-level loop and calling its private `_connect` / `_disconnect` / `_ping_loop`. Rewritten for nanoMuse's channel base; the arrangement is theirs.

### UI-TARS-desktop — Apache-2.0

The desktop app's hands on the computer are ported from [UI-TARS-desktop](https://github.com/bytedance/UI-TARS-desktop) (Copyright (c) 2025 Bytedance, Inc. and its affiliates), Apache-2.0:

- `harness/desktop/src/operator.ts` — the operator (`NutJSOperator` in `packages/ui-tars/operators/nut-js/src/index.ts`, `NutJSElectronOperator` in `apps/ui-tars/src/main/agent/operator.ts`, `getScreenSize` in `apps/ui-tars/src/main/utils/screen.ts`): the screenshot through Electron's `desktopCapturer` at the display's size with the libnut fallback, the action switch (move straight to the point, a 100 ms rest, then the click; drag; scroll; type through the clipboard; the hotkey table with `ctrl` as ⌘ on a Mac), the screen size as logical size × scale factor (1 on macOS), the mouse speed.
- `harness/desktop/resources/glow.html` — the prediction marker (`apps/ui-tars/src/main/shared/setOfMarks.ts`, `apps/ui-tars/src/main/window/ScreenMarker.ts`): the turning dashed ring with a dot at the point and the action's name beside it; the edge flow was already after their "screen water flow".
- `nanomuse/computer/coords.py` — `smart_resize` and the picture-size rules (`smartResizeForV15` in `packages/ui-tars/action-parser/src/actionParser.ts`, `parseBoxToScreenCoords` in `packages/ui-tars/sdk/src/utils.ts`: factor 28, the pixel bounds, the 1000-grid conversion).
- `harness/desktop/src/mac-permissions.ts` — the macOS permission arrangement (`apps/ui-tars/src/main/utils/systemPermissions.ts`): the two native modules below, `getAuthStatus` for Screen Recording and Accessibility, the system's own prompts at launch and the Screen Recording pane opened when it is missing; and the Chromium `disable-features` switch for ScreenCaptureKit thumbnails (electron/electron#44504) in `main.ts`.

Each file carries the attribution line; rewritten in nanoMuse's structure (the operator answers the runtime over loopback HTTP rather than running the model loop itself). The dependency `@computer-use/nut-js` (`harness/desktop/package.json`) is their fork of nut.js, Apache-2.0, with libnut's prebuilt addon per platform. Two more of their packages are optional dependencies of the desktop app, macOS only, both **MIT**: `@computer-use/node-mac-permissions` 2.2.2 (nut-tree's fork of Shelley Vohr's [node-mac-permissions](https://github.com/codebytere/node-mac-permissions); a prebuilt universal `permissions.node` — TCC status and the system prompts) and `@computer-use/mac-screen-capture-permissions` 1.0.2 (a fork of George Karagkiaouris's [mac-screen-capture-permissions](https://github.com/karaggeorge/mac-screen-capture-permissions); `CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess` through a small N-API addon built at install time on a Mac, with `electron-util`, `execa` and `macos-version`, all MIT, beneath it).

### Python and JavaScript dependencies

Installed from PyPI and npm, not vendored; each carries its own license: openai, pydantic, httpx, typer, rich, loguru, cryptography, tenacity, ddgs, beautifulsoup4, html2text, mcp, fastapi, uvicorn, qrcode, pywebpush, python-dateutil, pillow, pypdf (Python); lark-oapi, dingtalk-stream, wecom-aibot-sdk-python when the `channels` extras are installed; react, react-dom, react-markdown, remark-gfm, lucide-react, tailwindcss, vite (web); `@computer-use/nut-js`, `@computer-use/node-mac-permissions`, `@computer-use/mac-screen-capture-permissions` (desktop, above). `pip show <name>` / `npm view <name> license` for any of them.

### Tools called, not bundled

[bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) (LGPL-2.0-or-later) sandboxes commands on Linux when installed; [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) (Apache-2.0) drives the browser tool when the `browser` extra is installed. Neither is part of the package.

## Learned from, no code taken

- **Meta Muse** — the product shape: one agent with a name and a face, a feed, goals, "asks before anything you could not undo". nanoMuse is an independent project, not affiliated with or endorsed by Meta Platforms, Inc.; nothing of the Muse app was decompiled or copied.
- **[PhoneHarness](https://github.com/lsdefine/PhoneHarness)** — deterministic-first routing (a tool that does the thing exactly beats the GUI) and a JSONL trace per run rendered to HTML. Ideas only: the repository carries no license.
- **[CopilotKit/OpenMuse](https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenMuse)** (MIT) — product designs we follow rather than code: durable tasks with a take-control hand-off, watches, ideas with evidence, a follow-up queue, "content is evidence, not permission", background-update preferences.
- **[Open-AutoGLM](https://github.com/zai-org/Open-AutoGLM)** (Apache-2.0) and **[ClawGUI](https://github.com/ClawGUI/ClawGUI-APP)** (Apache-2.0) — reference points for operating a phone through its screen (package tables, Shizuku, a built-in IME, a floating bar). When code from either lands, it will be listed above.
- **[browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use)** (MIT) — the element-annotation idea behind the browser tool.
