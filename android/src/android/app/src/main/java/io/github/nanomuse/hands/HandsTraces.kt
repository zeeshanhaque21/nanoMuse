 * screenshot to `attachments/hands/<run>/step-N.jpg` next to the run's `trace.jsonl`; the chat
 * shows the last screenshot of a run. Those pictures are the person's screen, so they are not
 * kept without bound: once a run is older than the newest [KEEP_FULL_RUNS] runs it keeps its
 * trace and the one screenshot the chat shows, and beyond [KEEP_RUNS] runs the oldest run goes
 * altogether (the runtime keeps 200 traces and 400 screenshots, docs/gui.md). Pure file work, so
 * the unit tests run it on a temporary directory.
