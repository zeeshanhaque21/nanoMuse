/**
 * The first conversation, the way Muse does it: no form. After the three setup cards the user
 * lands in the chat, the app speaks first (a scripted opening, zero tokens), asks what to call
 * them, and then — with the model doing the talking — asks what they would like to call it. A
 * name chooser card appears under that question; the pick is written to SOUL.md on the spot,
 * so the header changes before the model has even replied.
 *
 * The model, not a regex, decides what the user meant. Its reply carries a small
 * `nanomuse-naming` block when something happened — the form of address was given (with two
 * name suggestions for the agent, in the user's language), or the agent was named — and the
 * app moves the [Phase] on that. A reply without the block means the user talked about
 * something else: the model helps with it and steers back, and the phase stays where it is.
 *
 * Everything the app shows on its own behalf here is virtual: the opening and the card live in
 * the view model's message list only, never in the database and never in the model's history.
 * The model learns what happened through a short system-prompt addendum for the current phase.
