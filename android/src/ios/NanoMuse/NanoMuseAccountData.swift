//
//  NanoMuseAccountData.swift
//  nanoMuse — contract C12 (0.1.40): what of this phone is the signed-in account's, and what
//  happens to it when the account leaves. The table is in docs/sync.md.
//
//  - Chats are rows in upstream's store; each has an owner here (`nanomuse-owners.json`): the
//    key of the account that was signed in when the session was first seen, or "" for one made
//    while nobody was. The lists, the search, the Chat tab and the sync engine show the current
//    owner's and no others (`shows`). Pre-0.1.40 sessions are claimed the same way the first
//    time the updated app runs.
//  - The agent's memory of the person (SOUL.md, USER.md, GLOBAL.md), the feed, the goals, the
//    routines, the face, the shared workspace and the account's few UserDefaults keys sit at
//    their fixed paths while the account is signed in, so upstream reads them where it always
//    did. When the account leaves they are put aside under `nanomuse/accounts/<hash>/` (*Keep
//    this account's chats on this device*) or deleted; the next account's come back from its own
//    folder or start empty. Signed out, the phone's own set (`_local`) is in place.
//  - Settings (providers and their keys, appearance, the hub's device identity) are the
//    phone's and never move. The relay's key is saved on this device only (not iCloud Keychain).
