//
//  The face in motion: one short looping clip per mood, drawn from that
//  mood's pose by the video model — Muse's fixed set: a head shake and a
//  sway at rest, the crystal ball while waiting, the five-pointed star when
//  pleased, headphones and a laptop while working. Clips live next to the
//  pictures (`avatar/motion/<mood>.mp4`) and the face view plays whichever
//  exists for the current mood, falling back to the still. Clips are made
//  one after another (each takes a few minutes and costs the person per
//  second) and only when a video model is set and the animation is on.
//  Android: avatar/AvatarMotion.kt.
