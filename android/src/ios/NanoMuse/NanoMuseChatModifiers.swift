//
//  Why these exist. `AIChatView.body` is one expression of some sixty chained
//  modifiers (sheets, alerts, listeners). Each link wraps the value so far in
//  another `ModifiedContent`: the body's value grows with every link, the
//  compiler holds the intermediate copies on the stack while the getter builds
//  the chain, and the Swift runtime — asked for the metadata of the finished
//  type the first time the body runs — recurses once per level of nesting.
//  0.1.38 added four links of ours (the composer's fail-safe host, the C9
//  presence hooks) and build 9 overflowed the main thread's stack on an iPad
//  the moment the chat appeared after onboarding, every launch: SIGSEGV in the
//  stack guard, `AIChatView.body.getter` →
//  `__swift_instantiateConcreteTypeFromMangledNameV2` →
//  `swift::Demangle::TypeDecoder::decodeMangledType` (Minis-2026-10-06-005159.ips,
//  symbolised with the dSYM of TestFlight run 9).
//
//  The cure: our links are grouped here into two modifiers, so the chain is
//  as long as 0.1.37's again, and the composer column and the popup layer are
//  boxed in `AnyView`s, so the body's value carries one pointer for the
//  largest subtrees instead of the subtrees themselves. New chat-wide
//  behaviour goes into these modifiers (or a third one), never as another
//  link on `AIChatView.body`; `NanoMuseRound6Tests.testChatBodyStaysSmallAndShallow`
//  keeps the depth in check.

import SwiftUI

/// The composer's place in the chat: a row under the message list, inside the safe area —
/// not an overlay of the list (upstream, 0.1.36–0.1.37) and not a safe-area inset of it (the
/// 0.1.38 fail-safe). A plain `VStack` has nothing to go wrong with: the list takes what is
/// left above the column, the keyboard shortens both, and the column is where SwiftUI put it
/// — which the check page (Settings → Appearance → Composer check) can now report in numbers.
/// The list needs no bottom inset for the composer any more (0 is passed to it). The `/` and
/// `@` popup and its tap-outside catcher stay an overlay of the list, so the popup's bottom
/// edge is the column's top edge by layout, as upstream's note wanted.
///
/// The composer that could not be seen in 0.1.36–0.1.39 was not this host's doing: the chat
/// as a whole ran under the shell's bottom bar once the keyboard had come and gone, and the
/// column — wherever it was attached — sat behind the bar. That is fixed where it was, in
/// `NanoMuseHomeView.body` (the bar is a row, not a safe-area inset); this host stays because
/// a row is the simpler of the two layouts and the one the Android app has.
