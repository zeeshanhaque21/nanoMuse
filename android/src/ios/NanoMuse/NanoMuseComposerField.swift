//  NanoMuseComposerField.swift
//  nanoMuse
//
//  The text field inside Muse's pill, SwiftUI's own. Three rounds of the
//  composer disappearing (0.1.36 the pill, 0.1.37 the watchdog, this one)
//  came down to the same anatomy: the field was upstream's
//  `PastableTextView`, a UIViewRepresentable, and the chat's bottom overlay
//  was therefore hosted by a UIKit container that iOS has been seen to leave
//  standing with no subviews — after a sheet, a keyboard, a background pass,
//  and on the maintainer's iPhone right after the first conversation's
//  naming card left that very stack. Nothing SwiftUI owns changed, so
//  nothing was redrawn, and the person was left with the tab bar and no way
//  to type.
//
//  A `TextField(axis: .vertical)` has no host of ours to lose: SwiftUI lays
//  it out and keeps it like any other view in the pill. What upstream's text
//  view did for the chat is kept through the field's own modifiers —
//  focus through `@FocusState` bridged to AIChatView's `inputFocused`,
//  Return → Send (the preference, and a hardware keyboard), the caret for
//  the @-mention detector, the arrow keys and Tab for the `/` and `@`
//  popups on iOS 17 and later. What it cannot do is said in docs/ios.md:
//  an image pasted into the field (the plus menu offers *Paste image*
//  instead), and the select-and-replace capture for the correction learner.
//
//  Android: the composer's BasicTextField in ChatScreen.kt.
