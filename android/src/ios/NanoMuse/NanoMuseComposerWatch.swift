//
//  NanoMuseComposerWatch.swift
//  nanoMuse
//
//  The composer that disappears: the watch behind it, and the evidence for
//  the next report.
//
//  Since 0.1.40 the composer column (the cards, the tool strip, the input
//  bar) is a row under the message list, inside the safe area
//  (NanoMuseComposerHost): one attachment point — no overlay of a UIKit
//  list, no second host to switch to. The watch stays as the last net for
//  the failure upstream saw on the device — a host that survives with no
//  subviews after a sheet, a keyboard or a background pass, while SwiftUI
//  has nothing to re-render for — and it keeps what it sees, so Settings →
//  Appearance → Composer check can show it without a Mac: the probe's last
//  sizes, the rebuilds, the events, and the UIKit frame of the column in
//  the window (NanoMuseComposerCheck.swift).
//
//  How: a probe `UIView` in the column's background says when it is
//  attached to a window and how tall the column really is; the input bar's
//  geometry callback reports every frame, zero included. Whenever one of
//  them looks wrong — detached while the chat is on screen, a zero-height
//  column, a zero frame, no wake-up after a foreground — the state is
//  re-checked a second later and, if still wrong, `rebuildTick` moves.
//  AIChatView puts `.id(tick)` on the column, so SwiftUI tears it down and
//  builds it again: the same recovery as leaving and re-entering the
//  session, without the trip. The text being typed lives in the view model
//  and survives; the focus does not, which is why a healthy composer is
//  never rebuilt, and why the watch rebuilds at most twice per appearance:
//  a column that is fine but mis-measured must not take the keyboard away
//  every few seconds.
//
//  0.1.37–0.1.39 switched to a second host (a bottom safe-area inset) when
//  the overlay reported nothing one second after the chat appeared. Three
//  TestFlight builds later the composer was still missing on the
//  maintainer's iPad — and the fault was never in the composer: the whole
//  chat ran under the shell's bottom bar once the keyboard had come and
//  gone (NanoMuseShell.swift, NanoMuseHomeView.body), so the column sat
//  behind the bar, laid out and healthy by every measure the watch has.
//  There is one host now, the bar is a row, and the check page says what
//  the device sees.
//
