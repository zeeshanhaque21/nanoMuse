//  NanoMuseSync.swift
//  nanoMuse
//
//  Contract C7, display rules C8: the account's conversations are the same
//  on every device. This is the client: a side table that gives each local
//  session a `cid` (upstream's schema is not touched), a push of the
//  person's line when it is sent and of the final assistant text when the
//  turn ends, a pull on launch, foreground, the hub's `sync` frame and every
//  minute, and the one-main-chat rule. The whole eligible history goes up
//  on sign-in (oldest first, 200 a POST, the first conversation included);
//  what comes down is inserted into the chat by time, deduplicated by `mid`,
//  and shown as the other device's bubble with a "From {device}" caption.
//  Pulled side conversations are ordinary chats here. Files and images stay
//  where they were made; only their names and sizes travel.
//  C9 (0.1.38): side chats are per device — "Also sync side chats", default
//  off: only the main goes up, the pull asks `scope=main`, side rows that
//  still arrive are ignored. Switching it on pulls everything once
//  (`since=0&scope=all&tail=300`, idempotent) and the side chats go up with
//  the next push. The first pull of a table is `since=0&tail=300`: the last
//  300 texts per conversation, not the whole history. Presence — "{device}
//  is working…" — is NanoMusePresence; this file tells it when a turn's
//  user line has been pushed and when the turn's end has.
//  C10 (0.1.39): a conversation belongs to the account that first pushed or
//  pulled it — the table that maps it is that account's, and every account
//  that ever synced on this phone keeps its table (`Tables`). Signed in as B,
//  the lists show B's and the unowned conversations, the push takes the same
//  (an unowned one becomes B's with its first push), and A's stay on the
//  phone, hidden, until A is back. A different account than last time starts
//  its table's cursor over (a `tail` pull) and clears presence. Signed out,
//  everything on the phone shows and nothing moves. Accounts are told apart
//  by the relay's opaque `account.id`, never by the identifier.
//  Relay: GET/PUT /v1/sync/state, GET/POST /v1/sync/changes,
//  DELETE /v1/sync/conversations/{cid}, DELETE /v1/sync/changes.
