        // Bridge. Detect the Codex OAuth backend (same condition
        // buildResponsesAPIRequest uses for endpoint selection, see
        // `isCodexOAuth` at line ~412) and transparently route through

        // get one response; we simply don't express that preference on
        // the wire.
        //
        // Scope. The branch is intentionally narrow so a regression
        // here can only affect Codex OAuth:
        //   • !useChat            — only the Responses API path; Chat
        //                           Completions instances are untouched
        //                           (they accept stream=false fine).
        //   • !forceResponsesAPI  — third-party Responses-compatible
        //                           endpoints (xAI etc.) work with
        //                           stream=false; only the literal
        //                           chatgpt.com Codex endpoint rejects.
        //   • isOAuth             — API-key OpenAI Responses API
        //                           accepts stream=false.
        //   • customBaseURL==nil  — user-supplied proxy bases are NOT
        //                           the Codex endpoint.
        //
        // Tradeoff. Streaming adds a few hundred ms of overhead vs a
        // single POST for short responses, but the alternative on
        // Codex OAuth is "request always fails", so this is strictly
        // better. Streaming chunks are concatenated in
