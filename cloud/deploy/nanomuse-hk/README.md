# nanoMuse Cloud on nanomuse-hk

The production relay behind `https://cloud.nanomuse.cn` runs on the same Hong
Kong box as the project site, behind the showcase's Caddy
(`demo/showcase`). This directory is everything specific to that box; the
relay itself is [`cloud/`](../../README.md).

| | |
|---|---|
| host | `nanomuse-hk` (SSH alias), Ubuntu 24.04, Docker |
| relay | `/opt/nanomuse/relay/` — `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, `src/`, `data/cloud.db` |
| container | `nanomuse-relay`, on the `showcase_edge` network, no published ports |
| TLS / vhost | `demo/showcase/sites.d/cloud.nanomuse.cn.caddy` → `nanomuse-relay:8787` |
| backups | `/opt/nanomuse/backups/cloud-*.db.gz`, daily 04:10 UTC, 30 days (`backup.sh`, systemd timer) |
| self-check | `selfcheck.sh` every 10 min (systemd timer): the public `/healthz`, the relay's `/v1/admin/health` (aggregates only: requests under way, hub counters, the hour's upstream errors and refusals, the database), free disk — one line in the journal (`journalctl -t nanomuse-selfcheck`); with `ALERT_URL` in `.env` (a webhook taking `{"text": …}`) a problem is posted there, once an hour per problem |
| admin | `https://cloud.nanomuse.cn/app/admin/`, token in `/opt/nanomuse/relay/ADMIN_TOKEN.txt` (0600) |
| DNS | DNSPod: `cloud` A → the box's address, same as the apex |

## First time

On the box, once, as the deploying user:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/nanomuse/relay && sudo chown "$USER" /opt/nanomuse/relay
cd /opt/nanomuse/relay
umask 077
cat > .env <<EOF
PUBLIC_BASE=https://cloud.nanomuse.cn

# e-mail addresses) have no limit, everyone else ¥10 for good, +¥5 an

```

Fill `ALLOWED_IDENTIFIERS` and `UPSTREAM_KEY` with an editor on the box (not
over a chat, not in a shell history: `nano .env`). Then, from a checkout on
a machine with the SSH alias:

```bash
cloud/deploy/nanomuse-hk/deploy.sh
```

which syncs `cloud/`, installs the compose file, the backup timer and the
Caddy site, builds and starts the container, and checks `/healthz` inside
the container and through the public name. The public check fails until the
`cloud` A record has spread and Caddy has fetched the certificate (a minute
after the record resolves).

## Every later deploy

```bash
cloud/deploy/nanomuse-hk/deploy.sh
```

The database and `.env` are never touched. A change to `.env` needs
`docker compose up -d` (or `deploy.sh`) to take effect.

## Day to day

```bash
ssh nanomuse-hk docker logs -f --since 10m nanomuse-relay      # codes when CODE_SENDER=log, errors
ssh nanomuse-hk 'cd /opt/nanomuse/relay && docker compose ps'
ssh nanomuse-hk /opt/nanomuse/relay/backup.sh                     # a backup right now
scp nanomuse-hk:/opt/nanomuse/backups/cloud-*.db.gz ~/backups/   # take a copy off the box monthly
```

Sign-up is open; everyone gets ¥10 for the account's lifetime and +¥5 per
person they invite (the person invited gets +¥5 too). Giving
someone more: *加额度* on the admin page (into their pool), or press *设为成员*
next to their account on the admin page (no restart), or add the number or
address to `ALLOWED_IDENTIFIERS` in `.env` and `docker compose up -d`.
Removing someone: disable or delete the account on the admin page. Closing
the door again: the *Sign-ups* switch under *Controls* on the admin page
(relay 0.22; no restart, a note for the audit log, members still sign in) —
or `SIGNUP_OPEN=0` in `.env` and `docker compose up -d` to make it the
default a restart comes back to.

Pausing — the switches under *Controls* on the admin page, or
`python -m nanomuse_cloud admin controls set <switch> off --note "…"` from the
relay's shell ([docs/cloud.md › Controls](../../../docs/cloud.md#controls)):
*Free allowance* stops the spending while sign-in, the hub and sync keep
working (the apps say so and offer the other ways on); *Cloud service*
answers every API call with 503 `service_paused` while the console, the health
check and `/v1/config` keep answering; *Conversation sync* and *Device hub*
pause one thing each. All of it comes back with the switch, nothing restarts.
A threshold rule (*at N accounts → notify / close sign-ups / pause the
allowance*) does the same by itself; `ADMIN_EMAIL` in `.env` is where
*notify* goes, and `ALERT_URL` is where the self-check posts a problem; with
either empty the line lands only in the audit log or the journal.

Kill switch — the process stops, nothing else on the box changes:

```bash
ssh nanomuse-hk 'cd /opt/nanomuse/relay && docker compose stop'
```

and `docker compose start` brings it back. Blanking `UPSTREAM_KEY` and `up -d`
also cuts the spending (the models answer 503 `upstream_unconfigured`), but
the *Free allowance* switch says it better to the apps.

## Restoring

```bash
ssh nanomuse-hk 'cd /opt/nanomuse/relay && docker compose stop \
  && gunzip -c /opt/nanomuse/backups/cloud-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.db.gz > data/cloud.db \
  && rm -f data/cloud.db-wal data/cloud.db-shm && docker compose start'
```

A backup is only readable with the `CLOUD_SECRET` it was written under;
`backup.sh` keeps a copy of `.env` next to the database copies for that
reason (`env.latest`, 0600).
