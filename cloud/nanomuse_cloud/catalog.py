"""The models under the operator's key, read from the provider — for members to pick from.

A member may name any model of the right kind (config.unlisted_model); until 0.10 they had to
know the id and type it. The relay now asks the provider's own ``GET /models`` (the
OpenAI-shaped list every compatible endpoint has) with the operator's key, sorts what comes
back into chat, image and video by the shape of the id, and lists the usable ones in
``GET /v1/models`` for members after the menu, marked ``listed: false`` and ``catalog: true``
— so the apps' pickers show them and the person chooses rather than types.

What the provider lists carries no modalities (``id``, ``object``, ``owned_by`` and a date), so
the first sorting is by name: ``image`` in the id is a picture model, ``t2v``/``i2v`` and their
kin a clip model, speech / transcription / embedding / reranking / live-translation ids are
left out (they do not answer chat completions), everything else is a chat model, with a
vision hint for the families known to read pictures.

Names lie, though — DeepSeek V4.1 on Model Studio reads pictures and V4 does not, half the
``qwen-*`` ids are retired and answer 4xx — so since 0.11 the relay *asks each chat model*
once (``probe``): a
one-word text request, and if that is answered, a one-word question about a small red
picture. A model that refuses the text request is left off the list; one that names the
colour is marked as reading pictures (``input_modalities`` carries ``image``), one that does
not is marked text-only. The answers are kept in the database for ``CLOUD_CATALOG_PROBE_TTL_S``
(a week) and the probing runs in the background after each refresh of the list, a few models
at a time, so no request waits for it. ``CLOUD_CATALOG_PROBE=0`` leaves the names to speak for
themselves, as before. A wrong guess still costs nothing: the kind is checked again when the
model is used, and an id a member types works as before.

Cached for ``CLOUD_CATALOG_TTL_S`` (an hour); a provider that does not answer leaves the last
good list in place, or none. ``CLOUD_CATALOG=0`` switches the whole thing off.
