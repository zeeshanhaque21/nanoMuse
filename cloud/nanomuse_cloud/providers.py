"""The own-key guidance (relay 0.21, contract C11): which providers a person can bring a key
from, what each one covers, and which paid plans an app can sign in with instead.

The facts come from the catalogue `providers.json` next to this file — a copy of the
runtime's `nanomuse/llm/providers.json`, written by `node scripts/providers-json.mjs` and
checked by CI, never edited here. The relay only orders it for the person's region and
adds the sign-in flows; the apps draw the card from it and the text is theirs (every
locale). The shape is additive next to the 0.17 `ways`, which keep their ids and fields.
