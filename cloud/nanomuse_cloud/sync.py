"""Conversation sync (0.19): the text of an account's conversations, kept so every device of
the account shows the same chats and a new device can catch up.

What is stored: conversations (an id, a kind, a title, which device started it) and messages
(an id, the role, the text — cut at 16 KB — and the names and sizes of attachments). Never a
file, never a picture, never anything of another account. One change counter per account
gives every accepted change a `seq`; a device keeps the highest seq it has seen (its cursor)
and asks for what came after it.

The main chat is one conversation for the whole account: the first `main` a device pushes
sets its id; a second one is refused with `main_exists` and the id to use instead. The
relay keeps the one it already has — devices' clocks disagree, the arrival order does not,
and every client already handles the refusal.

On by default for a signed-in account; turning it off deletes everything stored. Deleting
a chat tombstones the conversation (so the other devices drop it) and removes its texts at
once; tombstones go after 30 days. At most 20,000 messages per account: beyond that, the
oldest conversations' messages are dropped from the relay (devices keep their own copies).
At most 2,000 live side conversations: a new one past that is refused with
`conversation_limit` (0.23) and stays on the device.

Main first (0.20, contract C9). A device that only wants the account's main conversation
pulls with ``scope=main``; a fresh device asks for the tail — ``since=0&tail=300`` — and
gets the newest messages with their conversations instead of the whole store, so the first
sign-in shows a chat in seconds however big the history is. Presence rides alongside: a
device says ``working`` on a conversation when a turn starts there and when it ends; the
relay tells the account's other sockets and remembers the latest ``working: true`` for ten
minutes, in memory only — it is a hint for the screen, not data worth a table.
