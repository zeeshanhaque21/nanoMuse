# The public showcase

A page anyone can open: a phone in the browser with 微信, 支付宝, 铁路12306 and the other
[MobileGym](https://github.com/Purewhiter/mobilegym) apps on it, and nanoMuse installed. The
page opens on the nanoMuse app, and a **private nanoMuse is started for you** on the showcase
server — your own container, your own token, phone operation on — for thirty minutes and
within a model budget. Beside the phone are a few lines to try: a new look for the Muse
(it draws itself), the apps on the phone operated for you ("打开微信，看看张伟最新发来的消息"),
memory and reminders; a tap puts the line in the chat on the phone, and anything else can be
typed there. This is nanoMuse's web entry — what [nanomuse.cn/web](https://nanomuse.cn/web/)
leads to.

The page (`site/page/`) is plain HTML and a little script, with MobileGym in a frame on the
same origin as `/phone.html`; it talks to the nanoMuse app on the phone through
`window.__NANOMUSE__` on that frame (open, draft, reset, state, subscribe — see
`demo/mobilegym/README.md`) and the app passes drafts on to the web app over `postMessage`.
On a hosted session the web app runs lite (`?ui=lite`): the phone layout at any width, drawn
the way the Android app draws it — the face on its disc with the name tag under it, the round
hamburger and ••• menu, the chats drawer, the five tabs (chat, feed, ideas, goals, library) and
their pages, Settings as the phone's list of rows, the agent page behind the face, the
approval card — and no first-run setup.

**The phone keeps MobileGym's own chrome.** Around the frame are the pieces of
[mobilegym.dev](https://mobilegym.dev/)'s page, nothing cut down: the Gesture Guide on the
left (Back, Home and Recents as keys — the simulator is gesture-only — and a legend of the
gestures), the State Builder dock on the right with its drawer (session snapshots, the phone's
language, device time / battery / location, a WeChat message or contact, an Alipay balance or
bill, an SMS, a 12306 order, the weather — patched into the running phone), and *Power off*.
They are not copied into this repository: `site/compose.mjs` lifts the markup from the
checkout's `web/index.html` at build time and takes its `styles.css`, `state-builder.js`,
`boot-hero.js` and icons as they are (one default changed: the phone's address is
`/phone.html`), so an upstream change arrives with the next build. One thing is added to the
dock, first in it: nanoMuse's launcher icon, a shortcut — a tap brings the app to the front
(or turns the phone on), and it is lit while nanoMuse is the app on the screen; it carries no
State Builder tab, so their script leaves it alone (`page.js` handles it, reading `front` from
`window.__NANOMUSE__.state()`). Our column — the lines to try, the status, *Show nanoMuse* /
*Start over* — sits beside the phone; below 1280px their chrome folds under the phone and the
column follows.

Nothing about the phone runs on the server. MobileGym is a React app: the whole simulated
phone lives in the visitor's tab (~400 MB of *their* memory). The server runs three things:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Caddy** | HTTPS, the static site (the page at `/`, MobileGym + the nanoMuse app at `/phone.html`), `/api/demo/*` to the gateway, and one hostname per session |
| **gateway** (`gateway/`) | Starts a nanoMuse container per visitor, relays the phone's HTTP and WebSocket to it, proxies the container's model calls to the provider with the demo key, keeps the books |
| **sessions** | `ghcr.io/nano-muse/nanomuse` containers on an internal Docker network with no way out — the gateway is the only thing they can reach |

```
visitor's browser ──HTTPS──▶ Caddy ── demo.nanomuse.dev ──▶ /srv/site (the page; /phone.html = MobileGym + nanoMuse app)
   │  the page                   │                      └▶ /api/demo/* ──▶ gateway
   │   └ MobileGym phone (frame) └── <id>.s.nanomuse.dev ─────────────────▶ gateway ──▶ nm-<id>:8787
   │      └ nanoMuse app (iframe)                                                          │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘        │
          models, pictures, clips ◀── gateway ◀── /llm/<id>/{main,gui}[/images/*|/api/v1/*] ◀─┘
```

A session is one hostname (`<id>.s.nanomuse.dev`) because the nanoMuse web app and the
MobileGym module both take a server *origin*, and because the browser then keeps each session's
token in its own `localStorage`. The wildcard certificate that needs is why Caddy is built with
the Cloudflare DNS module.

## What the gateway enforces

- **One container per visitor**, `--read-only`, no capabilities, `no-new-privileges`, 512 MB,
  one CPU, 256 processes, tmpfs for `/data` and `/workspace`. Gone after `SESSION_TTL_S`
  (30 min) or `IDLE_TTL_S` (10 min) without traffic, and everything in it with it.
- **No network** from the containers except to the gateway (`docker network --internal`). The
  web fetch and shell tools cannot reach the internet from a demo session; the phone can.
- **The demo key never leaves the server.** Containers get a per-session key and
  `NANOMUSE_LLM_BASE_URL=http://gateway:8000/llm/<id>/main`; the gateway swaps the key and
  forwards to the provider. Streaming passes through; `usage` (asked for on streams) is what
  the budget counts.
- **Budgets:** per session `SESSION_LLM_REQUESTS` / `SESSION_LLM_TOKENS`, per day (Asia/Shanghai)
  `DAILY_LLM_REQUESTS` / `DAILY_LLM_TOKENS`. Over budget, the model call gets an OpenAI-shaped
  429 and the agent tells the visitor.
- **Per visitor (IP):** `PER_IP_ACTIVE` sessions at once, `PER_IP_DAILY` a day. `MAX_SESSIONS`
  overall.
- **Who is trying it** (`DEMO_SIGNIN_REQUIRED=1`, the default): before the phone starts a Muse,
  the visitor signs in to nanoMuse Cloud — the Android app's door, a code to a phone or an
  inbox or the account's password — on the phone's own pages (`demo/mobilegym`,
  `SetupPage.tsx`). The gateway puts the sign-in to the relay (`POST /v1/auth/code`,
  `/verify`, `/login`, the visitor's address forwarded), notes the account — its opaque id, the
  relay's masked identifier (`195****0404`, `g…@gmail.com`), the channel; never the identifier
  itself — in `VISITOR_DB` (SQLite on the `gateway-data` volume), revokes the device key the
  relay issued for the sign-in (the demo talks to the showcase's model, not to the account's
  allowance) and hands the browser a ticket good for `VISITOR_TTL_S` (thirty days).
  `POST /api/demo/session` wants the ticket as a bearer; without one it answers
  `401 signin_required`, and the phone shows the sign-in. A first sign-in creates the Cloud
  account, with its free allowance, so the day the person installs the app it is already
  theirs. One account is one person wherever it signs in from: `PER_ACCOUNT_ACTIVE` Muses at
  once, `PER_ACCOUNT_DAILY` a day, on top of the address limits. The session log names the
  visitor by the masked identifier; `GET /api/demo/info` → `signin` counts them. The book
  also keeps, per visitor, the address and browser string of the first and the latest
  sign-in or demo and how many sign-ins, and one *visit* row per demo started — when, from
  which address, with which browser, whether it brought its own key, and when it ended with
  what it used (requests, tokens, pictures, clips) and why (gateway 0.3). With
  `SHOWCASE_ADMIN_TOKEN` set, `GET /api/demo/admin` (header `X-Admin-Token`) hands all of it
  to the operator — `?account=<id>` for one visitor's — and the relay's admin page shows it
  (`WEB_ADMIN_URL` / `WEB_ADMIN_TOKEN` there) next to the account; without the token the
  route is not there.
- **Bring your own key:** the visitor can enter a provider URL, model and key on the setup page.
  The gateway keeps them in memory for the session and forwards with them (no budget of ours);
  the container never sees the key. Only `https://` to hosts in `BYOK_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (the usual
  providers), never to an address inside the server's network.

Two lanes: `main` (the model that talks to the visitor) and `gui` (the one that reads screens
and taps; many small calls with a screenshot each). The defaults are 阿里云百炼's `deepseek-v4-pro`
for the talk and, because DeepSeek takes no images, `qwen3.8-27b` for the screens — one key,
one host. A sighted `MAIN_MODEL` serves both lanes by itself; set `GUI_*` to split them.

**Pictures for a new look** (`gateway/showcase_gateway/images.py`): "换个形象：一只橘猫" in the
chat is the avatar studio's ([docs/avatar.md](../../docs/avatar.md)) — eight pictures: four
candidates, then the chosen one's poses. The container speaks the OpenAI images API at its
model's address (`…/images/generations`, `…/images/edits`); the gateway answers those two
calls itself, on Model Studio's native multimodal endpoint with the demo key, the way
nanoMuse Cloud's relay does, and tells the container the model's name
(`NANOMUSE_LLM_IMAGE_MODEL`). On by itself when `MAIN_BASE_URL` is a Model Studio host
(`IMAGE_MODEL=qwen-image-3.0`), off with `IMAGE_MODEL=` empty; `IMAGE_PER_SESSION` (12) and
`DAILY_IMAGES` (400) count apart from the chat budget. A visitor's own key draws nothing
through the gateway; `/api/demo/info` says `image_model: null` and the page greys the lines
out.

**Clips of the chosen face** (`gateway/showcase_gateway/clips.py`): after the stills the
studio animates the face — four short clips, one per mood — through the asynchronous video
API, which it looks for at `[llm] video_base_url`; the gateway names the session's own model
address there (`NANOMUSE_LLM_VIDEO_BASE_URL`), so the four calls of a clip land on it: the
upload policy, the first frame, the task, the polling. Model Studio wants the frame in its
storage or at a public URL, neither of which a container without internet can manage, so the
gateway stands in for the storage — the policy points back at it, the frame is kept a few
minutes and goes up with the task inline — and the finished MP4 comes back through it too.
`VIDEO_MODEL` (`wan2.2-i2v-flash` on a Model Studio host, empty for stills only),
`CLIPS_PER_SESSION` (4, one face) and `DAILY_CLIPS` (120).

### Trial credentials for the phone app

The same proxy can hand a new phone its first model. With `TRIAL_ENABLED=1`, `POST /api/trial`
with `{"device": "<a random id the app keeps>"}` answers with a key (`nmt_…`) and two
addresses — `https://<SITE_HOST>/llm/trial/<id>/main` and `…/gui` — that go straight into the
app's `[llm]` and `[gui]` settings. Every call through them is metered against the trial's
lifetime budget, `TRIAL_TOKENS` (a million); spent, the proxy answers 429 `trial_exhausted` and
the app asks for the user's own key. One trial per device: asking again with the same id
rotates the key and keeps the count, so a reinstall recovers nothing extra. New trials are
capped per address (`TRIAL_PER_IP_DAILY`) and per day (`TRIAL_DAILY_NEW`, 200); all trials
together may spend `TRIAL_DAILY_TOKENS` a day; each is held to `TRIAL_RPM` requests a minute.
Trials live in SQLite on the `gateway-data` volume and survive restarts; `GET /api/trial/<id>`
with the key shows what is left, and `/api/demo/info` carries the totals.

### nanoMuse Web: a kept Muse per Cloud account

The showcase gives a visitor a Muse for half an hour. With `WEB_ENABLED=1` the same gateway
gives a *person* one that stays — a kept Muse per account, for anyone who would rather not
install anything. With it off (the default, and what nanomuse.cn runs since 0.1.26: the
phone in the browser, with its sign-in, took the web version's place), `/web/` redirects to
the showcase site — the phone — so [nanomuse.cn/web/](https://nanomuse.cn/web/), which the
project site's Caddy block hands to the gateway, stays the web entry either way. On, `/web/`
is a sign-in page (served by the gateway; the site's Caddy block hands `/web/*` and
`/api/web/*` over to it): an e-mail or a mobile number, then the six-digit code.
The gateway asks nanoMuse Cloud for the code and checks it (`POST /v1/auth/code`,
`/v1/auth/verify`, the visitor's address forwarded so the relay's per-address limits still
count the right person), gets the account's key back, and starts — or wakes — the account's
container: `nmw-<slug>` with three named volumes (`/data`, `/workspace`, `/home/muse`), on the
`nanomuse-web` network (a way out, and the relay next to it), signed in from the environment
(`NANOMUSE_CLOUD_KEY`, `NANOMUSE_CLOUD_BASE_URL=http://nanomuse-relay:8787`,
`NANOMUSE_HUB_NAME=Web`, `NANOMUSE_ONBOARDED=1`; `nanomuse/hub/service.py`,
`_seed_from_env`). The browser is sent to `https://<slug>.<SESSION_DOMAIN>/?token=…`, the same
door the phone's QR code opens, and the runtime there makes the Cloud its model on first
start and takes its place on the hub as one of the account's devices — so the phone can ask
it for things and it can ask the phone.

What the gateway keeps is small (`WEB_DB`, SQLite on the `gateway-data` volume): account id →
slug, access token, and when the key the container was started with runs out. The key itself
is a *session key* the relay issues to lapse on its own (`POST /v1/auth/session-key`,
`WEB_KEY_TTL_S`, 30 days); it goes into the container's environment at creation and is kept
nowhere else — the standing key the sign-in produced is signed out again at once. The slug is
an HMAC of the relay's opaque account id, so signing in from another browser lands in the same
Muse (with a fresh key: the container is recreated around the same volumes); once the key has
lapsed, the Muse is not woken — the person signs in again, which does the same. A container
that has been quiet for `WEB_IDLE_STOP_S` (six hours) is stopped, not removed; the next
request on its host that carries the account's token (the bearer header, the socket's first
frame, a signed link) starts it again, which takes a few seconds — a browser arriving with
only the address gets a small page that takes the token from the app's storage and asks for
the wake, so a bookmark still works and a stranger typing the address starts nothing.
`WEB_MAX_RUNNING` containers run at once — when
every place is taken the quietest sleeps to make room, unless it was used in the last five
minutes (`503 web_busy`) — and `WEB_MAX_ACCOUNTS` may exist at all (`503 web_full`). Model
use is the account's own allowance on the relay; the gateway meters nothing here.

## Deploying

You need: a Linux box with Docker (4 cores / 8 GB is plenty for `MAX_SESSIONS=20` — a session
idles at ~150 MB), a domain on Cloudflare, and a 百炼 key (or any OpenAI-compatible provider
that takes images).

```bash
# 1. DNS on Cloudflare:   demo.nanomuse.dev  A  <server>   DNS only (see the note on the proxy)
#                         *.s.nanomuse.dev   A  <server>   DNS only — sessions are WebSockets to Caddy
#    Cloudflare → My Profile → API Tokens: Zone → DNS → Edit and Zone → Zone → Read on the zone.

# 2. the code
git clone https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse.git && cd nanoMuse/demo/showcase
cp .env.example .env && $EDITOR .env          # names, ACME_EMAIL, CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, keys

# 3. what the sessions run
docker pull ghcr.io/nano-muse/nanomuse:latest  # or: docker build -t nanomuse:latest ../.. && set NANOMUSE_IMAGE

# 4. (optional, 1.9 GB) MobileGym's companion data: app media and home-screen widgets.
#    Without it the phone works but media apps render empty and two home widgets show an error.
mkdir -p data && curl -L https://github.com/Purewhiter/mobilegym/releases/download/data-v0.1.0/mobilegym-data-v0.1.0.tar.gz | tar -xz -C data
#    CC BY-NC 4.0 — non-commercial use only (see MobileGym's LICENSE-DATA).

# 5. up — the published images (.github/workflows/showcase.yml builds them from main) …
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
#    … or build them here (clones MobileGym and compiles Caddy; a few minutes):
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f gateway
```

Open `https://demo.nanomuse.dev`, find nanoMuse in the launcher (search works), and it starts.
`curl https://demo.nanomuse.dev/api/demo/info` shows sessions in use and today's spend.

Updating: `git pull && docker pull ghcr.io/nano-muse/nanomuse:latest && docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.
Sessions in flight end when the gateway restarts; visitors get *Your Muse on the showcase server
has ended* and a button for a new one.

Both certificates are obtained through Cloudflare's DNS API (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`); the
records themselves stay "DNS only". Cloudflare's proxy can be switched on for `SITE_HOST`
when the site is under attack — Caddy is built with the
[cloudflare-ip](https://github.com/WeidiDeng/caddy-cloudflare-ip) module and trusts
`X-Forwarded-For` from Cloudflare's ranges only, so `PER_IP_*` keeps counting visitors rather
than edges (set the zone's SSL/TLS mode to *Full (strict)*: the origin has a real certificate).
It is off by default on purpose: from mainland China the free plan routes through overseas
edges, and the phone's 1.6 MB bundle that a Hong Kong server delivers in 2–3 s took 15–40 s
through the proxy in our measurements. The audience this is for reaches the origin faster.

### Other sites on the same Caddy

The Caddyfile ends with `import /etc/caddy/sites.d/*.caddy`, and `docker-compose.yml` mounts
`sites.d/` there and `www/` (or `WWW_ROOT`) at `/srv/www`, both read-only and both ignored by
git. One file per site, its files under `www/<name>/`, then `docker compose up -d caddy` — a box
that has no such sites is unchanged.

The project site is served this way at [nanomuse.cn](https://nanomuse.cn): `mirror/` holds the
site block and `sync.sh`, which a systemd timer runs every minute to pull
[nano-muse.github.io](https://github.com/nano-muse/nano-muse.github.io) into `www/nanomuse.cn/`
— a push to that repository is on the mirror within the minute, with no key or webhook anywhere.
`sudo mirror/install.sh` sets up all of it and is safe to run again after `git pull`. What is not
in the repository: two A records at the registrar (`nanomuse.cn`, `www.nanomuse.cn` → this box).
A server outside mainland China needs no ICP filing for a `.cn` name; one inside does.

The same box mirrors the releases: `mirror/release-sync.py`, run by a second timer every fifteen
minutes, asks the GitHub API for the newest two releases (drafts and pre-releases skipped) and
fetches every asset into `www/dl/<tag>/`, checking each against the SHA-256 GitHub records for it;
`www/dl/latest` points at the newest tag, `www/dl/index.json` lists what is there, older tags are
removed. The site block serves the directory at [nanomuse.cn/dl/](https://nanomuse.cn/dl/) with a
listing, and the site's download switch ("GitHub / 国内镜像") rewrites its links to
`https://nanomuse.cn/dl/<tag>/<file>`. About 1.3 GB per release; `MIRROR_RELEASES_KEEP` in
`/etc/default/nanomuse-site-mirror` changes how many are kept. `install.sh` installs this too and
starts the first fetch in the background (`journalctl -u nanomuse-release-mirror` to watch it).

And it counts: the site block writes a JSON access log (`logs/caddy/`, rolled, kept seven days),
and `mirror/traffic.py` — `nanomuse-traffic`, every ten minutes — turns what was added since the
last run into daily counts in `/var/lib/nanomuse-traffic/traffic.db`: page views, visitors (a
hash of address and browser under a salt made for the day and dropped two days later; no address
is ever written), crawlers, downloads per file from `/dl/`, referring sites, the pages; once a run
it also records the repository's stars and GitHub's own release download counts. The relay
(cloud/deploy/nanomuse-hk) mounts the database read-only and shows it on its operator page;
`nanomuse-traffic --report` prints the last two weeks in the terminal.

### Running it on your machine

The gateway runs anywhere Docker does; Caddy is only for TLS and names. Browsers resolve
`*.localhost` to the loopback, so:

```bash
docker network create --internal nanomuse-sessions
docker build -t nanomuse:local ../..                        # the sessions' image
site/build.sh                                              # clones MobileGym, builds with VITE_NANOMUSE_DEMO=/api/demo, adds the page
cd gateway && pip install -e '.[dev]' && cd ..
PUBLIC_SCHEME=http SITE_HOST=localhost SESSION_DOMAIN=s.localhost PUBLIC_PORT=:8000 \
NANOMUSE_IMAGE=nanomuse:local SITE_DIR=$PWD/site/dist \
MAIN_API_KEY=sk-... python -m showcase_gateway              # http://localhost:8000
```

`site/build.sh /path/to/mobilegym` builds from a checkout you already have. The page itself
needs no bundler: edit `site/page/` and run `build.sh` again, or just
`node site/compose.mjs /path/to/mobilegym site/page site/dist` to recompose it with
MobileGym's chrome. The phone's media is MobileGym's companion data at `/cdn` (`CDN_DIR`, or
`./data/mobilegym-data` in the compose file); without it the launcher's theme widgets show their
error cards and the media apps render empty, as on an upstream checkout without it — or build
with `MOBILEGYM_CDN_BASE=https://cdn.mobilegym.dev` (a build arg of the same name in the compose
file) and the phone takes it from MobileGym's CDN, as their own site does.

`cd gateway && pytest` runs the gateway's tests (no Docker needed; the containers are faked).

## Costs, roughly

A session that asks two or three things, one of them on the phone, is 5–15 model calls and
20–60k tokens: about ¥0.05–0.2 at DeepSeek/百炼 prices. Two hundred sessions a day is ¥20–40.
A new look is eight qwen-image pictures, about ¥2; `DAILY_IMAGES` (400) bounds that at ¥100 a
day, `IMAGE_PER_SESSION` (12) at one face and half a redraw per visitor. The four clips of the
chosen face are about ¥2 more with wan2.2-i2v-flash (4 s, 480P); `DAILY_CLIPS` (120) bounds
that at ¥60 a day, `CLIPS_PER_SESSION` (4) at one face per visitor. The daily caps in
`.env.example` (3,000 calls / 6M tokens) bound the chat's worst day at a few tens of yuan;
lower them if you like. Put a spending alert on the provider accounts too — the gateway's
counters live in memory and start from zero when it restarts.

## Known limits

- One gateway, one host. The session counters are in memory (the trials are in SQLite); that is
  fine for a showcase and would need a shared store to scale out.
- The gateway starts and stops containers, which is a lot of power over the host. It reaches
  Docker through `docker-proxy` (compose: `tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy`), which passes the
  container and network calls and refuses the rest — no exec, images, volumes or build — and
  holds the socket itself read-only on a network of its own; the gateway container has no
  socket. It is still the trusted part; keep it off the public network (compose does: only
  Caddy is published).
- A visitor's own provider (BYOK) is resolved and checked once, when the session starts, and
  the session's calls are pinned to the addresses found then — the name travels only as SNI
  and `Host`, the certificate is checked against it as usual — so a name that answered with a
  public address cannot be re-pointed at one inside our network later (DNS rebinding).
- No egress from sessions means the search, fetch and browser tools fail inside a demo. That is
  the point of the demo — the phone — but say so if visitors ask.
- The MobileGym data set is CC BY-NC 4.0; the showcase is non-commercial.
