"""Keeping a session's token out of the server's own log lines.

The clients open the socket bare and send the token as the first frame, and the phone's page
carries it in the address's fragment; the gateway's own lines name a path without its query.
What remained was uvicorn: its request line is the path with the query string as it arrived,
so a page or an app still on the older ``?token=`` form put the token in the log with every
upgrade (``"WebSocket /ws?token=…"``, on ``uvicorn.error``) and every page load (``"GET
/?token=…"``, on ``uvicorn.access``); and httpx, which names the whole URL of every request
the gateway relays to a container at INFO. The filter below sits on those loggers and rewrites
any ``token=`` value before a handler sees the record. The older form is still accepted this
release; it is only never written down.
