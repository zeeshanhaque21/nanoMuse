# The Android app

`android/` is nanoMuse for the phone: [OpenMinis](https://github.com/OpenMinis/OpenMinis)
1.13 (GPL-3.0) — a native app whose agent runs **on the phone**, with a Linux shell, a
browser, MCP servers, skills and scheduled tasks inside the APK — with nanoMuse's own
identity, design and features on top. Everything of nanoMuse's lives in
`io.github.nanomuse.*`; edits inside OpenMinis files are marked `// nanoMuse:`. The
history of this choice is in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md); what came before it (a WebView
around a Python server, two APK flavours) is kept as a design record in
[archive/android-python-line.md](archive/android-python-line.md) and is not what you
download today.

One APK, one architecture: `nanoMuse-<version>-arm64.apk` (arm64-v8a, Android 8.0 / API 26
or newer, `targetSdk` 35). Every release is signed with the same key, so a newer APK
installs over the old one and keeps its data. No Play Store listing: the app checks this
repository's GitHub Releases for a newer version and offers the download (*Settings →
About*).

## Install

1. Download `nanoMuse-<version>-arm64.apk` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse/releases/latest). Verify with
   `sha256sum -c nanoMuse-<version>-arm64.apk.sha256` if you like.
2. Open it. Android asks once to allow installs from your browser or file manager.
3. **Sign in.** The first screen is the account: a phone number or an e-mail address,
   a code — or a password once you have set one. It is what lets your devices work as one
   ([hub.md](hub.md)) and brings a model to start with ([cloud.md](cloud.md): ¥10 free per
   account, ¥5 more for each friend invited — and ¥5 for them; then [your own key](own-key.md)). Then choose which model answers: the account's
   own, or a key of your own (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or the OAuth sign-ins the
   app ships with). Running everything yourself with no account at all is the runtime's
   `cloud.required = false`; the phone app asks for the account.
4. Optional: the two permissions that let the agent use your phone's apps (skippable and
   revocable), and *Settings → Image & video models* for a look that can change and move.

## What the phone does

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **The agent, on the phone** | A sandboxed Alpine Linux, a real shell, files, a browser, MCP servers, skills in the Agent Skills format, memory, scheduled tasks; approvals before deleting, sending or paying. The model is the account's or your own; nothing you say passes through the project's relay when you use your own key. |
| **Hands** (`hands/`) | With *Hands* on and the accessibility service enabled, the agent looks at the phone's screen and taps, types and swipes in its apps — the last rung after APIs, fetches and the browser. A stage over the app shows where it is about to tap and a capsule with the step and **Stop**. Passwords and codes are always yours to type. [gui.md](gui.md) is the design record; the app's own hands are in `io.github.nanomuse.hands`. |
| **Reach** (`reach/`) | Your computers, from the phone: "say it on the phone, it gets done there" — a shell command, a file, the computer's screen, or a whole task for the nanoMuse running there. The way in is the hub (next row): install nanoMuse Desktop on the computer and sign in with the same account, and it is under *Account → Devices* within seconds, on any network — the only way since 0.1.24 (the local-network host script is gone). *Settings → Computers* lists the account's computers and says which account the phone uses, since a missing computer has nearly always signed in with another one. Approvals are decided on the phone before anything is sent. [every-device.md](every-device.md). |
| **The hub** (`hub/`) | Every signed-in device of the account meets on the relay's hub: the phone sees your computers, asks them to do things, gets their approvals as cards, and can be asked by them. A foreground service keeps it reachable in the background (Android 13+ asks for the notification permission for that). [hub.md](hub.md). |
| **Coding agents** (`ui/coding/`) | The Cursor, Codex and Claude Code sessions on your computers, seen and steered from the phone. [coding-agents.md](coding-agents.md). |
| **Account** (`ui/cloud/`) | Who is signed in, the password, every device holding a key, usage by kind and by model, the ways out. |

The web console of the same account is at the relay (`/app`), the desktop app in
[desktop.md](desktop.md); the phone, the desktop and the web share the design language
described in [brand.md](brand.md).

## Privacy and permissions

The relay keeps an account id, a masked identifier, usage counts and the agent's name and
look (so your devices match) — never message content ([privacy.md](privacy.md)). On the phone, API keys, the account key and Reach
pairing tokens are in `EncryptedSharedPreferences`; the backup rules
(`res/xml/nanomuse_backup_rules.xml`, `nanomuse_data_extraction_rules.xml`) keep every
secret store out of device backups and transfers. Hands needs the accessibility service
and the overlay permission, both optional and both revocable from the same screen; a
step that sends something — a tap on *Send*, or Enter in a message field of a messenger —
is approved one at a time, and *for this chat* answers stay bound to the app or address
they were given for. Another device of your account that wants to run, read or write
something on the phone (hub `shell`, `files`, `open`, `screen`…) is approved by the person
holding the phone first — *once* or *always for that device*, revocable under Permissions.
The app allows plain `http://` only for addresses on your own network (`10.x`,
`172.16–31.x`, `192.168.x`, `.local` names) — a model server or a computer of your own —
and refuses it at the provider URL field for anything else (`io.github.nanomuse.net.LanOnly`);
the relay and the hub are TLS only. The in-app web view is not exported to other apps.

## Building it yourself

JDK 17 and the Android SDK (Android Studio installs both); `scripts/android/env.sh` sets
the environment on a bare machine. The project is under `android/src/android`:

```bash
cd android/src/android
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug        # app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease      # signed with android/keystore.properties when present
```

`scripts/rebrand.py` carries the version (`VERSION_NAME`, `VERSION_CODE`) and applies
nanoMuse's naming to the OpenMinis tree; `android/BUILDING.md` covers the native pieces.
Without a signing key the release build is signed with the debug key, which installs but
cannot update a properly signed build. To sign, create a key once and keep it outside the
repository:

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -keystore ~/.nanomuse-release/nanomuse.jks -alias nanomuse \
        -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10950
```

and put its four values in `android/keystore.properties` (git-ignored: `storeFile`,
`storePassword`, `keyAlias`, `keyPassword`).

## Releases

`.github/workflows/android.yml` builds the debug APK on every change under `android/`
(the "debug APK · arm64-v8a" check). A release is made from a tag by
`scripts/release-apk.sh <version>`: it checks the version against `rebrand.py` and
Gradle, builds `:app:assembleRelease` with the release key, writes
`dist/nanoMuse-<version>-arm64.apk` and its `.sha256`, and with `--publish` tags
`v<version>` and attaches both to the GitHub release with the notes from
`docs/releases/v<version>.md`. A debug-signed APK never goes on a release, because it
could not be updated by a properly signed one. The `versionName` must match the tag,
like the Python package's version does.

## Where things are

| Path (`android/src/android/app/src/main/java/io/github/nanomuse/`) | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `cloud/NanoMuseCloud.kt` | The account: sign-in with a code or a password, the key in the encrypted store, `/v1/me`, usage, sessions, the localized error sentences |
| `hub/` | `Hub` (state, device identity, settings), `HubClient` (the socket with backoff; stops when the relay refuses the key), `HubService` (the foreground service), `HubActions` (what other devices may ask this phone), `HubErrors` (failures in words) |
| `reach/` | `Computers` (paired computers, tokens in the encrypted store), the offload handler that sends work to a computer |
| `hands/` | The accessibility service as the hand, the stage and the capsule, the screen reader |
| `ui/coding/` | The coding agents of your computers |
| `ui/cloud/` | Sign-in, the Account screen, the Devices section |
| `res/values*/nm_strings.xml` | Every nanoMuse string, in English, 简体中文 and 繁體中文 (the three files carry the same keys) |
