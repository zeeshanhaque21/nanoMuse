# The Android app

`android/` is nanoMuse for the phone: [OpenMinis](https://github.com/OpenMinis/OpenMinis)
1.13 (GPL-3.0) — a native app whose agent runs **on the phone**, with a Linux shell, a
browser, MCP servers, skills and scheduled tasks inside the APK — with nanoMuse's own
identity, design and features on top. Everything of nanoMuse's lives in
`io.github.nanomuse.*`; edits inside OpenMinis files are marked `// nanoMuse:`. The
history of this choice is in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md); what came before it (a WebView
around a Python server, two APK flavours) is kept as a design record in
[archive/android-python-line.md](archive/android-python-line.md) and is not what you
download today.

One APK, one architecture: `nanoMuse-<version>-arm64.apk` (arm64-v8a, Android 8.0 / API 26
or newer, `targetSdk` 35). Every release is signed with the same key, so a newer APK
installs over the old one and keeps its data. No Play Store listing: the app checks this
repository's GitHub Releases for a newer version and offers the download (*Settings →
About*).

## Install

1. Download `nanoMuse-<version>-arm64.apk` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse/releases/latest). Verify with
   `sha256sum -c nanoMuse-<version>-arm64.apk.sha256` if you like.
2. Open it. Android asks once to allow installs from your browser or file manager.
3. **Sign in.** The first screen is the account: a phone number or an e-mail address,
   a code — or a password once you have set one. It is what lets your devices work as one
   ([hub.md](hub.md)) and brings a model to start with ([cloud.md](cloud.md): a free pool per
   account — ¥10 at the time of writing — and more for each friend invited, and for them;
   the app prints the relay's current figures; then [your own key](own-key.md)). Then choose which model answers: the account's
   own, or a key of your own (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or the OAuth sign-ins the
   app ships with). Two models are set, not one: the **chat model** (the account's menu
   opens on `deepseek-v4.1-flash`; picking another in the Cloud group makes new chats follow
   it) and the **Hands model** under *Settings → Hands*, the one that looks at the screen
   (`qwen3.8-27b` — the account's, or the same model under your own key; you can pin any
   model that sees). Running everything yourself with no account at all is the runtime's
   `cloud.required = false`; the phone app asks for the account.
4. Optional: the two permissions that let the agent use your phone's apps (skippable and
   revocable), and *Settings → Image & video models* for a look that can change and move.

## What the phone does

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **The agent, on the phone** | A sandboxed Alpine Linux, a real shell, files, a browser, MCP servers, skills in the Agent Skills format, memory, scheduled tasks; approvals before deleting, sending or paying. The model is the account's or your own; nothing you say passes through the project's relay when you use your own key. |
| **Hands** (`hands/`) | With *Hands* on and the accessibility service enabled, the agent looks at the phone's screen and taps, types and swipes in its apps — the last rung after APIs, fetches and the browser. A stage over the app shows where it is about to tap and a capsule with the step and **Stop**; when a tap would send, post or delete, the capsule itself asks — **Allow** / **Deny**, the same request the chat card and the notification show — so you are not pulled back into nanoMuse (money is confirmed with the screen lock in the chat card; the capsule offers *Open* for that one). Passwords and codes are always yours to type. [gui.md](gui.md) is the design record; the app's own hands are in `io.github.nanomuse.hands`. |
| **Reach** (`reach/`) | Your computers, from the phone: "say it on the phone, it gets done there" — a shell command, a file, the computer's screen, or a whole task for the nanoMuse running there. The way in is the hub (next row): install nanoMuse Desktop on the computer and sign in with the same account, and it is under *Account → Devices* within seconds, on any network — the only way since 0.1.24 (the local-network host script is gone). *Settings → Computers* lists the account's computers and says which account the phone uses, since a missing computer has nearly always signed in with another one. Approvals are decided on the phone before anything is sent. [every-device.md](every-device.md). |
| **The hub** (`hub/`) | Every signed-in device of the account meets on the relay's hub: the phone sees your computers, asks them to do things, gets their approvals as cards, and can be asked by them. A foreground service keeps it reachable in the background (Android 13+ asks for the notification permission for that). [hub.md](hub.md). |
| **Coding agents** (`ui/coding/`) | The Cursor, Codex and Claude Code sessions on your computers, seen and steered from the phone. [coding-agents.md](coding-agents.md). |
| **Account** (`ui/cloud/`) | Who is signed in, the password, every device holding a key, usage by kind and by model, the ways out. When the free pool is spent or past 80 %, the account page and the refused turn show the two ways on: an invitation, and your own key — Alibaba Cloud Bailian first for people in mainland China (the UI in simplified Chinese, a phone-number sign-in, or the relay saying so), OpenRouter first everywhere else with *Sign in with OpenRouter* as the one button (Bailian only signs up accounts from the mainland); the other vendor is a text link away. |
| **The browser handed over** (`browser/`) | A page that needs you — a login, a verification code, a payment, a CAPTCHA — is handed over instead of described: `browser_use`'s `hand_over` action opens the agent's own tab (same WebView, same session) in the browser sheet with the agent's hold released, a **Your turn** card above the composer says what the page asks of you with *Open the page* and *Done, continue*, the sheet carries the same line and button, and the tool call waits for *Done* (fifteen minutes at most) before the agent goes on from the page as it is. `io.github.nanomuse.browser.BrowserHandOver`. |
| **Connectors** (`connectors/`, `ui/connectors/`) | The services the agent can be let into — the desktop's catalogue of 75 remote MCP servers (Notion, Linear, GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Stripe, Miro, …), shipped as `assets/nanomuse/connectors.json`. The only Settings row for all of this is *Connectors*; the upstream MCP editor (by address, by command, imported JSON) is *Your own servers* at the end of the page. Open servers add with a tap; a key service takes the key; an OAuth service runs the MCP authorization flow (discovery, dynamic client registration, PKCE in a Custom Tab) and the token goes into the entry's `Authorization` header for the in-guest MCP client, refreshed at app start; a service whose authorization server registers no clients (`clientIdRequired` — GitHub, Slack, Discord, HubSpot, Render, Bitrise, PagerDuty, Box) asks for an OAuth client id and secret made at the vendor's developer page with the app's callback address, which the sheet shows and copies. A connected service is an MCP server entry under the same id — *Your own servers* manages it too. What is connected is shared with the account's other devices through the relay profile — the entries (id, label, address, kind of auth, which device, when), never a token — so the page also lists *On your other devices*: a service connected on the desktop shows as *Connected on <device> — sign in here to use it on this phone*, one tap into the same sheet. |
| **The chat, plain** | While the agent works, the line under its avatar names the step under way — *nanoMuse is using Shell*, *Writing the reply*, *On it: book the table* — never a state of mind. The tool pills, the Computer sheet and the floating step bar are **off by default**; *Settings → Appearance → Show the agent's steps* turns them on. With them on, a finished step reads *nanoMuse used Shell · Done*, and its sheet closes on ×, swipe or Back. |

The web console of the same account is at the relay (`/app`), the desktop app in
[desktop.md](desktop.md); the phone, the desktop and the web share the design language
described in [brand.md](brand.md).

## Privacy and permissions

The relay keeps an account id, a masked identifier, usage counts and the agent's name and
look (so your devices match) — never message content ([privacy.md](privacy.md)). On the phone, API keys, the account key and Reach
pairing tokens are in `EncryptedSharedPreferences`; the backup rules
(`res/xml/nanomuse_backup_rules.xml`, `nanomuse_data_extraction_rules.xml`) keep every
secret store out of device backups and transfers. Hands needs the accessibility service
and the overlay permission, both optional and both revocable from the same screen; a
step that sends something — a tap on *Send*, or Enter in a message field of a messenger —
is approved one at a time, and *for this chat* answers stay bound to the app or address
they were given for. Another device of your account that wants to run, read or write
something on the phone (hub `shell`, `files`, `open`, `screen`…) is approved by the person
holding the phone first — *once* or *always for that device*, revocable under Permissions.
The app allows plain `http://` only for addresses on your own network (`10.x`,
`172.16–31.x`, `192.168.x`, `.local` names) — a model server or a computer of your own —
and refuses it at the provider URL field for anything else (`io.github.nanomuse.net.LanOnly`);
the relay and the hub are TLS only. The in-app web view is not exported to other apps.

## Building it yourself

JDK 17 and the Android SDK (Android Studio installs both); `scripts/android/env.sh` sets
the environment on a bare machine. The project is under `android/src/android`:

```bash
cd android/src/android
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug        # app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease      # signed with android/keystore.properties when present
```

`scripts/rebrand.py` carries the version (`VERSION_NAME`, `VERSION_CODE`) and applies
nanoMuse's naming to the OpenMinis tree; `android/BUILDING.md` covers the native pieces.
Without a signing key the release build is signed with the debug key, which installs but
cannot update a properly signed build. To sign, create a key once and keep it outside the
repository:

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -keystore ~/.nanomuse-release/nanomuse.jks -alias nanomuse \
        -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10950
```

and put its four values in `android/keystore.properties` (git-ignored: `storeFile`,
`storePassword`, `keyAlias`, `keyPassword`).

## Releases

`.github/workflows/android.yml` builds the debug APK on every change under `android/`
(the "debug APK · arm64-v8a" check). A release is made from a tag by
`scripts/release-apk.sh <version>`: it checks the version against `rebrand.py` and
Gradle, builds `:app:assembleRelease` with the release key, writes
`dist/nanoMuse-<version>-arm64.apk` and its `.sha256`, and with `--publish` tags
`v<version>` and attaches both to the GitHub release with the notes from
`docs/releases/v<version>.md`. A debug-signed APK never goes on a release, because it
could not be updated by a properly signed one. The `versionName` must match the tag,
like the Python package's version does.

## Where things are

| Path (`android/src/android/app/src/main/java/io/github/nanomuse/`) | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `cloud/NanoMuseCloud.kt` | The account: sign-in with a code or a password, the key in the encrypted store, `/v1/me`, usage, sessions, the localized error sentences; the relay's menu and its two defaults (`for: chat` / `for: gui`) |
| `cloud/Region.kt`, `cloud/OwnKeyPresets.kt`, `cloud/ProfileSync.kt` | Which own-key vendor comes first (mainland → Bailian, else OpenRouter); the pre-filled provider forms; the relay profile (name, look, connectors) pulled and pushed |
| `hub/` | `Hub` (state, device identity, settings), `HubClient` (the socket with backoff; stops when the relay refuses the key), `HubService` (the foreground service), `HubActions` (what other devices may ask this phone), `HubErrors` (failures in words) |
| `reach/` | `Computers` (paired computers, tokens in the encrypted store), the offload handler that sends work to a computer |
| `hands/` | The accessibility service as the hand, the stage and the capsule, the screen reader; `Hands.screenModel` picks the Hands model (chosen → the Cloud's `qwen3.8-27b` → the same under your own key → a chat model that sees → the Vision Group) |
| `ui/coding/` | The coding agents of your computers |
| `connectors/`, `ui/connectors/` | The connectors catalogue (`ConnectorsCatalogue` reads the asset), MCP authorization discovery + registration (`McpAuthDiscovery`), connecting and token refresh (`Connectors`), what this phone connected as published to the profile and what the other devices did (`SharedConnectors`), the Settings → Connectors page |
| `ui/cloud/` | Sign-in, the Account screen, the Devices section |
| `res/values*/nm_strings.xml` | Every nanoMuse string, in English, 简体中文 and 繁體中文 (the three files carry the same keys) |
