`android/` is a native shell around the web app, in two flavours:

- **nanomuse.apk** (`local`) runs nanoMuse **on the phone itself**: the Python server, its tools and a small Alpine Linux live inside the app, unpacked on first start and run under a user-mode chroot. Nothing to install on a computer. arm64 phones, Android 8.0 or newer. How it works, what it can and cannot do: [local-runtime.md](../local-runtime.md).
- **nanomuse-connect.apk** (`connect`) is the **remote for a `nanomuse serve` on your computer** — the same web app in a WebView, plus what a browser tab cannot do on a home network: notifications while the app is closed. Web Push needs `https://` and a push service in the middle; the app keeps its own connection to your server instead. Any CPU.

The local build offers both on its first screen (*Run on this phone* / *Connect to my computer*), so it is the one to download unless the phone is 32-bit or storage is tight.

What the shell adds over the browser tab:

- **Connect by QR code.** Scan the code `nanomuse serve` prints; no typing addresses or tokens.
- **Notifications in the background.** A foreground service keeps one WebSocket open to your server. Approvals, questions and the last word of background work arrive as Android notifications and open the right chat. A resolved approval takes its notification down again. Reconnects after a network change or a reboot.
- **Attachments, downloads, links.** The file picker for the paperclip, downloads to the phone's Downloads folder, links opening in the real browser.
- **The agent's browser.** While the app is connected, its own WebView is a browser the agent may use — offscreen, on a private virtual display so pages run at full speed with the app in the background — and *Take over* on a browser card slides that very page up for you to sign in or decide, then **Done**. In the local build this is the only browser there is; with a server it is used whenever the app is connected (`[browser] backend`). [browser.md](../browser.md).
- **Operating the screen.** With the *Phone* switch on (*Connections → Phone*) and the app's accessibility service enabled, the agent can look at the phone's screen and tap, type and swipe in its apps — the last rung after skills, fetches and the browser. Android 11 or newer. A capsule with the current step and a **Stop** button sits over the operated app the whole time; a `FLAG_SECURE` screen stays black to it and it refuses to type into password fields. [gui.md](../gui.md).
- **Plain HTTP on the LAN.** Works with `http://192.168.x.x:8787` as is.

Everything else is the same web app, served by your `nanomuse serve`.

## Install

Download [`nanomuse.apk`](https://github.com/zeeshanhaque21/nanoMuse/releases/latest/download/nanomuse.apk) (always the current release; the same file is also there as `nanomuse-<version>.apk`; the connect-only build is [`nanomuse-connect.apk`](https://github.com/zeeshanhaque21/nanoMuse/releases/latest/download/nanomuse-connect.apk)) and open it on the phone. Android asks once to allow installs from your browser or file manager. Android 8.0 (API 26) or newer. Every release is signed with the same key, so a newer APK installs over the old one and keeps its connection and data.

**Run on this phone**: tap it, wait for the unpack (about a minute; ~330 MB of storage), and the app opens on the onboarding: give the agent a name, paste a model API key. That is all; there is no computer involved. The runtime shows a quiet *Running on this phone* notification while it is up, comes back after a reboot, and can be stopped from that notification.

**Connect to my computer**: on the computer,

```bash
nanomuse serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

Tap **Scan QR code** and point the camera at the terminal. Or paste the printed link (`http://…:8787/?token=…`) into the field. The app checks the address and the token against the server before it keeps them.

The app on the phone and the server on your computer need to reach each other: same Wi-Fi, or a VPN such as Tailscale, or the server behind a reverse proxy with TLS (`https://` works too). See [deployment.md](../deployment.md) for reaching the server from outside your network.

## Notifications

*Settings → Notifications → Let … notify this phone* turns the background connection on and off. While it is on, a silent "Connected to …" notification sits in the tray: that is Android's requirement for a service that stays alive, and it can be minimised in the notification's own settings. Turning it off stops the service; the web app itself still shows everything when it is open.

Updates arrive through the same connection, so there is nothing to configure on the server and no third party sees the content. In local mode the runtime's own notification carries the same role, and the approvals, questions and results come from the same code.

## Keeping it running

Android stops apps that look idle, and the vendors' Android stops them sooner. The agent already does its part: it runs as a foreground service, holds the phone awake only while a task runs, and in local mode asks Android to wake it at the moment the next reminder, goal check-in or background pass is due (an alarm set for the runtime's `next_wake_at`; see [local-runtime.md](../local-runtime.md#waking-up)). *Settings → Keep it running* shows the three switches that let it keep that promise on this phone, each with an *Allow* / *Open* button that jumps to Android's own page:

- **Battery** — *Unrestricted* or *Optimised*. Optimised means Android may freeze the process after a while with the screen off; routines and check-ins then wait until the phone wakes. The button raises Android's own dialog (`ACTION_REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`).
- **Display over other apps** — needed to bring the app to the front from the background (the *Open* button on a notice card) and for the status capsule while it works in other apps. Not needed for the GUI executor itself: its overlays come with the accessibility service.
- **Alarms & reminders** (local mode only) — *Exact* or *Approximate*. Android 14 denies `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` to a fresh install; the app then falls back to an inexact alarm (`setAndAllowWhileIdle`), which fires within the system's batching window — usually a few minutes late, never early. Granting the permission makes reminders punctual.
- **Start after a reboot** — a switch, on by default. In connect mode the notification service reconnects when the phone restarts; in local mode the runtime starts again in the background. Off, the app waits until you open it.

Vendor Android needs one more step, and the section names it when it recognises the phone: 小米 / Redmi (*自启动* and *后台弹出界面*, both under the app's settings in 安全中心), 华为 / 荣耀 (*应用启动管理* → turn off automatic management, allow all three), OPPO / realme / OnePlus (*自启动* plus *允许后台运行*), vivo / iQOO (*后台高耗电* and *自启动*), 三星 (*Sleeping apps* — remove the app; *Deep sleeping apps* must not list it), 魅族 (*后台管理* → allow). *Open the auto-start settings* tries the vendor's own activity and falls back to the app's details page when the phone does not have it. The vendor page names move between releases, so the section describes what to look for rather than a fixed menu path; [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com) keeps a current list per vendor.

Crashes are written to a file on the phone (`files/crashes/`, the last five) and nowhere else — the app has no crash reporter and no analytics. *Export logs* bundles them with the app's recent logcat (its own process only), the runtime's log in local mode and a one-page summary (versions, mode, which of the switches above are on) into a zip and hands it to the share sheet, so you can look at it or send it to someone you choose. Nothing is sent unless you send it.

## Disconnect

*Settings → About → Disconnect from this server* forgets the address and the token and returns to the first screen. Uninstalling does the same. The token is stored in the app's private storage and excluded from cloud backups. In local mode, *Start over* on the failure screen returns to the first screen too, and keeps the phone's data (`files/home`); uninstalling removes it.

## Building it yourself

JDK 17 or newer and the Android SDK (Android Studio installs both). Then:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleConnectDebug    # app/build/outputs/apk/connect/debug/app-connect-debug.apk
./gradlew assembleConnectRelease  # app/build/outputs/apk/connect/release/app-connect-release.apk
```

The `local` flavour also needs the root file system and PRoot in place first — `scripts/rootfs/build.sh` (Docker + QEMU) and `android/native/build-proot.sh` (the NDK), both in the history at the tag `pre-openminis`, put them under `android/app/src/local/`; see [local-runtime.md](../local-runtime.md#building-the-pieces). Then `./gradlew assembleLocalDebug`.

Without a signing key the release build is signed with the debug key, which installs fine but cannot update a build signed with a different key. To sign properly, create a key once and keep it outside the repository:

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -keystore ~/.nanomuse-release/nanomuse.jks -alias nanomuse \
        -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10950
```

and tell Gradle about it in `android/keystore.properties` (ignored by git):

```properties
storeFile=/home/you/.nanomuse-release/nanomuse.jks
storePassword=…
keyAlias=nanomuse
keyPassword=…
```

The same four values can come from the environment as `NANOMUSE_STOREFILE`, `NANOMUSE_STOREPASSWORD`, `NANOMUSE_KEYALIAS`, `NANOMUSE_KEYPASSWORD`.

## Releases

`.github/workflows/android.yml` builds the connect APK and runs the unit tests on every change under `android/`; on pushes to `main` and on `v*` tags it also calls `rootfs.yml` for the root file system and PRoot, builds both release APKs, checks the local one against its size budget (80 MB), and on a tag attaches `nanomuse-<version>.apk`, `nanomuse-<version>-connect.apk`, `nanomuse.apk` and `nanomuse-connect.apk` to the GitHub release — but only when it could sign with the release key, which the repository gets from four secrets: `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_B64` (the `.jks` file, base64), `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`. Without them the workflow still builds an APK signed with a throwaway debug key and keeps it as a workflow artifact; the maintainer then attaches the APK built locally with the real key. A debug-signed APK never goes on a release, because it could not be updated by a properly signed one.

The `versionName` in `android/app/build.gradle.kts` must match the tag, like the Python package's version does.

## How it is put together

| File | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `ConnectActivity.kt` | The first screen: *Run on this phone* (unpack, start, wait) / *Connect to my computer* (QR scan / paste, checks `GET /api/state` with the token) |
| `MainActivity.kt` | The WebView: loads `<server>/?token=…`, file picker, downloads, external links; the offline / starting / failure screen |
| `NotifyService.kt` | Remote mode: foreground service with an OkHttp WebSocket to `/ws?token=…` |
| `Notifier.kt` | Events → notifications, shared by both services |
| `runtime/RuntimeService.kt`, `runtime/LocalRuntime.kt`, `runtime/TarUnpacker.kt` | Local mode: the runtime on the phone ([local-runtime.md](../local-runtime.md)) |
| `Bridge.kt` | `window.NanoMuseAndroid` — the web app uses it to show phone settings instead of Web Push, to know the mode, and to read the accessibility service's state and open the settings that turn it on |
| `DeviceLink.kt` | The device on the app's WebSocket: announces `gui` / `capsule` / the app list (again whenever the accessibility service comes or goes) and answers `screen`, `act`, `task` and `browser` requests |
| `gui/MuseAccessibilityService.kt`, `gui/A11yExecutor.kt`, `gui/NodeTree.kt` | The screen executor: screenshot (downscaled to 720 px wide), gestures, global actions, typing with a clipboard fallback, the element tree with stable ids, an event-based wait for the UI to settle |
| `gui/GuiOverlay.kt` | Two accessibility overlay windows: the finger marks (rings, lines, typed text, caption) and the capsule with the step and **Stop**, which grows into a notice card when the agent needs you; both hidden while a screenshot is taken |
| `device/` | The phone's own capabilities as a loopback MCP server ([device.md](../device.md)) |
| `runtime/WakeAlarms.kt` | Local mode: the alarm for the runtime's `next_wake_at` — exact when allowed, inexact otherwise — and the receiver that pokes the service |
| `KeepRunning.kt` | The state of the battery, overlay and exact-alarm permissions, the vendor guess, and the intents that open the right settings page |
| `Diagnostics.kt` | Crash files (`files/crashes/`, local only) and *Export logs* (a zip through a `FileProvider` to the share sheet) |
| `BootReceiver.kt` | Starts the notification service or the runtime after a reboot when *Start after a reboot* is on |
| `Prefs.kt` | Mode, server URL, token, the local port and token, the notifications and boot switches, the agent's name |

The events the service reacts to are the same ones the web app draws cards for: `approval` / `question` with `status: pending` (and their resolution), and `assistant` events with `source: background` and `final: true`. `demo/mobilegym/apps/nanoMuse/bridge.ts` does the same job for the simulator, in TypeScript.
