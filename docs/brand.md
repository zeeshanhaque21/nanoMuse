# nanoMuse brand

Decided 2026-09-24. The app icon and the in-app colour system are one decision: the palette
is derived from the icon so the whole app matches the tile on the home screen.

## The mark

One continuous pen stroke that reads as an **N**: a hooked entry, one rounded peak, a long
diagonal, a tight valley, and an upward exit. It follows the same visual grammar as Muse's
single-stroke mark (Muse's is an M with three arches; ours is an N with one) — the same way
OpenManus rhymes with Manus while being a different gesture. The mark is abstract on purpose:
it is a gesture first and a letter second.

- Source of truth: `assets/brand/nanomuse-icon-source-1024.png` (final render, white squircle on
  brand blue). Everything else is derived from it.
- `assets/brand/nanomuse-mark.svg` — the stroke alone, traced as a single filled path, viewBox
  `0 0 100 100` in tile coordinates, gradient fill.
- `assets/brand/nanomuse-icon.svg` — white squircle tile (`rx=27`) + mark. This is the app icon.
- `assets/brand/nanomuse-icon-on-blue.svg` — the icon on the brand-blue backdrop, for
  store listings and the splash only. Wherever the icon stands for the app — README, site,
  social card, favicon — it is the plain tile: white, the mark, a hairline edge, no backdrop.
- `assets/brand/nanomuse-mark-rgba-688.png` — the stroke with alpha, 688 px, raster fallback.
- `docs/app-icon.png` — the tile rendered with rounded corners (27 % radius, transparent
  outside, a hairline `#D9D9DE` edge so it keeps its shape on white), 512 px: the icon as it
  sits on a home screen. This is the README hero and the picture to use wherever
  the app is shown as an app.

The icon is **not** the mascot. The default face is the bundled **dragon** (`web/public/avatars/`,
the Android app's `avatar/`); the other choices are an emoji on a colour and a face made in
the avatar studio. The red panda of the early releases retired in 0.1.23. Never put the dragon
(or the old red panda) on the launcher icon, and never put the N mark in the chat as a face.

## Colour

Measured from the icon.

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `brand.stroke.start` | `#015CFB` | left end of the mark's gradient |
| `brand.stroke.end` | `#0186FB` | right end of the mark's gradient |
| `brand.blue` | `#0078FD` | backdrop behind the tile; splash; hero backgrounds |
| `tile` | `#FFFFFF` | icon tile |

### Light theme

| Token | Value | Contrast | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `primary` | `#015CFB` | 5.35 on white | links, primary buttons (white text), active tab, send button, status line |
| `primary.container` | `#E5F0FF` | — | user bubble, selected rows, chips |
| `primary.tint` | `#EEF5FF` | — | subtle highlighted surfaces |
| `bg.grouped` | `#F2F2F7` | — | page background (unchanged from OpenMinis) |
| `surface` | `#FFFFFF` | — | cards, input |

### Dark theme

| Token | Value | Contrast | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `primary` | `#58A6FF` | 8.3 on `#000`, 6.7 on `#1C1C1E` | links, buttons (black text), active tab, status line |
| `primary.container` | `#1A2B4A` | — | user bubble |
| `bg` / `surface` / `surface.2` | `#000000` / `#1C1C1E` / `#2C2C2E` | — | unchanged from OpenMinis |

Rules: one accent hue only. Code blocks, thinking text and links that OpenMinis coloured with
iOS blue, orange and green become `primary` plus neutrals. Rust orange from the red panda stays
inside the avatar; it is not a UI colour.

## Android mapping (done in S1)

- Adaptive icon: background layer = solid `#FFFFFF`; foreground layer = the mark as a
  `VectorDrawable` whose `fillColor` is the two-stop linear gradient above; monochrome layer =
  the same path with a flat fill (Android tints it).
- Icon skins (activity aliases kept from OpenMinis): *Auto* = white tile; *Light* = white tile;
  *Dark* = `#0F1B33` tile with a white mark.
- Notification small icon: the mark, flat white, 24 dp.
- Never ship the old OpenMinis icon, name or the letter-n drafts.

## Don'ts

- Don't recolour the mark outside the blue gradient / flat white / flat black.
- Don't rotate, outline, or add a shadow to the stroke.
- Don't place the mark on the brand blue without the white tile (contrast).
- Don't use Meta's Muse mark, name or blue as an asset; the kinship is in the gesture only.
