# nanoMuse Cloud

The "start now" path: sign up with a phone number (mainland China; the code comes by SMS)
or an e-mail address, get a free allowance, and use nanoMuse without an API key of your own.
Bringing your own key still works exactly as before — this is one more
provider, not a replacement.

## In the app

Since 0.1.20 the account is where every app starts: the first screen asks for a
phone number or an e-mail address and sends a six-digit code — or, once you have
set one, takes your password — and then asks which model answers: the account's
own (the Cloud) or a key of your own. Codes by SMS reach mainland China numbers
only (号码认证服务 sends nowhere else); a Hong Kong, Taiwan or overseas number is
told so at once (`phone_region`) and signs in with an e-mail address instead.
Signing out brings that screen back
(self-hosters: `[cloud] required = false` or `NANOMUSE_CLOUD_REQUIRED=0` on the
runtime). After the code the app has:

- a provider called **nanoMuse Cloud** under *Settings → Providers*, an
  ordinary OpenAI-compatible provider whose key is the token the relay issued;
- a model group with the recommended chat model, set as the default if you had
  none;
- the relay's picture model as the avatar's image model, if none was set.

*Settings → nanoMuse Cloud* (the *Account* screen) shows who is signed in (a
masked hint, never the number) and since when; sets, changes or removes the
**password** (eight characters or more; scrypt on the relay; locked for a while
after repeated wrong attempts, and a fresh code sign-in unlocks it); today's
spend against the allowance in ¥ and $ with a meter; **usage by kind** —
chat, pictures, video — today and in all, and **by model**; the
**sign-ins** — every device holding a key, how it signed in (code or password),
when it was last used — each revocable; the account's own **history** (sign-ins,
password changes, refusals; never message content); and the ways
out: *Sign out* on this device, *Sign out everywhere*, *Delete the account*.
The allowance belongs to the address: signing in again, on
this phone or another, gives a new key for the same account and does not grant
a second allowance.

Signing in a second provider next to it — your own Model Studio key, DeepSeek,
a local server — works as always; the relay's models can be mixed with yours
in a model group.

## What the relay keeps

The relay is the code in [`cloud/`](../cloud/README.md). It stores:

- a salted hash (HMAC-SHA256) of the e-mail address (phone accounts from
  0.1.18–0.1.21 keep working), a masked hint such as `so***@example.com`, and
  the address itself encrypted (AES-GCM, key derived from the relay's secret)
  so the operator can see who an account belongs to on the admin page — the
  database file alone shows nothing;
- the hash of each key issued, with the device name you signed in from, how
  (code or password) and when it was last used; revoked keys keep their row
  so the sign-ins list can say so;
- the password, if you set one, as an scrypt hash — never the password;
- per request: the kind (chat, picture, video), the model, the token counts
  and the amount charged;
- a timeline of account events — signed in, failed sign-in, password set or
  changed, signed out, refused for budget, upstream error — with a
  device name, a model or an error code as the detail, never message content;
- the id of each video task, so only the account that started one can poll it;
- the agent's name and look (`/v1/me/profile`): which face it wears — the dragon,
  an emoji on a colour, or one drawn in the avatar studio, with that face's five
  stills as small WebP pictures — so every device of the account shows the same
  one. Never a key or a setting.

Images and tool results are never stored, and message content only as the
*Data controls* section below says — with the switch off, nothing: the request
is forwarded to the upstream model (Alibaba Cloud Model Studio) and the reply
is streamed back. Every response carries an `X-Nanomuse-Request` id so a problem report
can be matched to a ledger row without any content being logged. Deleting the
account (`POST /v1/auth/delete` with the account's key) removes all of it. See
[privacy.md](privacy.md).

## Allowance

### Data controls

*Settings → Data controls → Help improve nanoMuse's AI models* is a switch each
person owns, the same on the phone, the web app, the desktop and the console.
Off, the relay forwards a chat request and keeps nothing of it. On, each turn
is kept as a training view: what you wrote, what the model answered and the
tool calls it chose, with the model, the token counts and the app's platform
and language from the request headers, tied to the account id only — never the
system prompt (your memory, SOUL and instructions), never what a tool returned
(your files, your screen, what another app showed), never a picture, a clip or
a voice note (a marker stands where one was). The point is a training set for
the community's own open model. The page shows how many turns are kept; turn
the switch off at any time (nothing more is kept) and delete what was kept
with one tap; deleting the account deletes it too. Nothing is credited for
the switch either way. On `cloud.nanomuse.cn` the switch is **on for accounts
created from relay 0.9 on, until the person turns it off** — the privacy
policy says so, the page says so next to the switch, and accounts from before
keep the choice they had made; a self-hosted relay sets its own default with
`IMPROVE_DEFAULT`. The operator sees the kept turns on the admin page's *Data
controls* panel (how many accounts have it on, turns by day, model and app,
the newest turns, every account's kept conversations in full) and exports them
as JSON lines without account ids or addresses (`GET /v1/admin/samples/export`,
`?account_id=` for one account's). The relay does not receive a location — the
apps never send one — but from relay 0.10 it records the network address and
the client software (`User-Agent`: the Android app and its version, the
runtime on Windows / macOS / Linux, a browser) with each sign-in, request,
event and device, and keeps the account's first and last address; the admin
page shows them per account and per address (`GET /v1/admin/address?ip=`), and
they are deleted with the account. From relay 0.11 the admin page also says
where an address is — country, province, city — looked up in an offline copy
of ip2region's database on the relay's own disk; no third party is asked, and
nothing more is stored (the place is computed when the page is drawn).

nanoMuse is a community project and charges nothing. The public relay at
`cloud.nanomuse.cn` is paid for by the developer, so each account has a pool
to draw on — for its lifetime, not by the day (relay 0.5):

| | `cloud.nanomuse.cn` |
|---|---|
| sign-up | open to anyone with a mainland China mobile number or an e-mail address |
| free allowance | **¥10 per account**, across chat, pictures and clips; it does not reset |
| invitations | each *new* person who signs up with your code adds **¥5** to your pool — and ¥5 to theirs |
| when it is gone | bring your own key — [Alibaba Cloud Bailian in about two minutes](own-key.md), or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint; sign-in and your devices are unaffected |
| members | the developer and the people they list have no limit, and may set any model the provider has (a chat model for chat, an image one for pictures, a video one for clips): the apps' model picker lists them after the menu as *More models on your account* (relay 0.10 reads the provider's list under the Cloud key), and an id can still be typed — *Other model…* |
| rate | 30 requests per minute |
| tokens | no ceiling; usage is metered and shown |

Spend is counted at the model provider's list prices (Alibaba Cloud Model
Studio, Beijing region, September 2026): `qwen3.8-27b` ¥3 in / ¥12 out per
million tokens, `qwen3.8-flash` ¥0.8 / ¥2.7, `qwen-image-3.0` ¥0.18 a
picture, `wan2.2-i2v-flash` ¥0.10 a second of video at 480P (a 5-second clip
is ¥0.50). A typical day of chatting costs a few fen; ¥10 is roughly
seven hundred thousand tokens of the 27B model or fifty pictures. A new face —
four candidates, four poses and four clips — comes to about ¥3.5, and the app
shows the estimate and what is left before it draws.

*Settings → nanoMuse Cloud* shows what was used of the pool in ¥ and $, what
is left, and how the pool grows. At 80 % the app says so once; when the pool
is spent the relay refuses with `allowance_exhausted` and the app shows the
two ways on: your own key (Alibaba Cloud Bailian first — the provider form
opens pre-filled, [guide](own-key.md)) or an invitation (+¥5 for each of you).
Other relays may set other rules (`ALLOWANCE_CNY`, `INVITE_BONUS_CNY`,
`SIGNUP_OPEN`, `ALLOWED_IDENTIFIERS`; see
[`cloud/README.md`](../cloud/README.md)).

## Running your own

Anyone can run a relay — for a family, a class, a company — and point the app
at it. The server is a single Python process over SQLite; a VPS with Docker and
a domain name is enough:

```bash
cd cloud
cp .env.example .env    # domain, secrets, upstream key, how codes are sent
docker compose up -d    # Caddy fetches the TLS certificate
```

[`cloud/README.md`](../cloud/README.md) has the settings, the sender options
(SMTP for e-mail, Aliyun SMS for mainland phones), the admin endpoints for
topping up, and the test suite.

A relay for one person, or a few: `SIGNUP_OPEN=0` with
`ALLOWED_IDENTIFIERS=139…, me@example.com` lets only those numbers and
addresses sign in; everyone else gets `not_invited` before any code is sent.
The trial deployments ran this way. With sign-up open, the same list names
the members who have no daily cap; the admin page can add more.

The relay is also the meeting point for the account's devices — the **hub** at
`/v1/hub` and the web console at `/app`; see [hub.md](hub.md). `HUB_ENABLED`
turns it off, `HUB_FRAME_LIMIT` caps one frame (files and screenshots travel
inside frames, 16 MB by default).

This fork has no default relay. The sign-in screen has a *Relay server* field:
point it at your own relay (a self-hosted relay, or on the emulator the host
machine at `http://10.0.2.2:8787`). The field is available in release builds,
not only debug builds. The desktop and the web console take the relay from
`NANOMUSE_CLOUD_BASE_URL` (or the app's own settings); the harness takes it from
its config. Running with no relay at all is the default (`[cloud] required = false`
and an empty `base_url`); configuring a relay is explicit and never falls back
to another service. The `cloud.nanomuse.cn` pool and table below describe the
upstream public relay for reference, not this fork's default.

## Protocol

The app's calls, all JSON:

```
POST /v1/auth/code          {identifier}                      → 204
POST /v1/auth/verify        {identifier, code, device}        → {api_key, base_url, account, tokens, models}
POST /v1/auth/login         {identifier, password, device}    → the same; 401 bad_credentials, 429 locked, 400 no_password
POST /v1/auth/password      Bearer  {password, current?}      → 204; "" with current removes it
GET  /v1/me                 Bearer                            → {account{…, has_password, sessions, signed_in_via}, usage{today, total by kind / model}, tokens, spend, models, recent}
GET  /v1/me/sessions        Bearer                            → {sessions: [{prefix, device, via, created_at, last_used_at, current}]}
DELETE /v1/me/sessions/{prefix}  Bearer                       → 204
GET  /v1/me/events          Bearer  ?limit=50                 → {events: [{ts, kind, detail}]}
POST /v1/auth/sign-out      Bearer                            → 204
POST /v1/auth/sign-out-all  Bearer  {all?}                    → {signed_out}
POST /v1/auth/delete        Bearer                            → 204
```

Everything else is the OpenAI API: `GET /v1/models` (with `architecture`
modalities so the picture model is recognisable), `POST /v1/chat/completions`
with streaming, `POST /v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits`. Errors
are `{"error": {"message", "type": "nanomuse_cloud", "code"}}` with a stable
`code` the app turns into a sentence.

Devices: `GET /v1/devices` lists the account's devices (online or last seen),
`DELETE /v1/devices/{id}` forgets an offline one, and `WS /v1/hub` is the hub
itself — the frames are in [hub.md](hub.md).
