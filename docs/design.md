# Design: what nanoMuse takes from Muse, and where it differs

A study of Muse's screens — the announcement, the walkthrough and sizzle videos, the app screenshots Meta published — and the choices nanoMuse made from it. It exists so that the app stays coherent as it grows and so that a contributor can tell "on purpose" from "not yet". Nothing here is Meta's code or assets; the plush dolls, the red panda and the layouts are the project's own.

## What Muse looks like

**Surfaces.** Near-white (`#fcfcfc`-ish) in light mode and near-black in dark; no gradients, no card shadows to speak of. Depth comes from one step of grey (a `surface-2`) for bubbles, chips and the tab bar. One accent, a saturated blue, used sparingly: the send button, links, the status line while something runs, the selected tab.

**Type.** Meta's own *Optimistic*; large, friendly, tight letter-spacing on headings, generous line-height in bubbles. Everything is set in one family at three or four sizes.

**Chat.** The agent's bubbles are grey, yours are light blue, both with large radii. Tool use is not hidden: a small chip per action ("Checking price", "Found 3 options") that opens into detail. Approval requests are cards inside the conversation, with the exact action spelled out and buttons that say what they do. Files the agent made appear as tiles with a preview.

**The avatar.** A plush doll with a name — Meta's launch examples were Veda, Sunny and others — photographed against a warm plain background. It sits at the top of the chat inside a circle, with the agent's name under it and a one-line status ("Checking price") under that. It is not one picture: the doll changes pose with what the agent is doing — at a laptop with headphones on while it works, waving when it greets you, idle otherwise — and it moves a little: a sway, a blink. Tapping it opens a sheet: the doll large, the same status, a *Stop* control on the running task, then a segmented control — activity, approvals, permissions, upcoming — and the list for the selected one, grouped by day.

**Navigation.** A floating bar at the bottom with five icons and no labels: Chat, Feed, Ideas, Goals, Library. Chat is the home. Everything else the agent has — memory, connections, settings — lives behind the avatar.

**Feed, Ideas, Goals, Library.** Feed: posts written for you, with a place to say what you want more of. Ideas: a grid of suggestions grouped by area, tap to send. Goals: a list with progress, each opening to a plan with steps and a next check-in. Library: what the agent made, newest first, with previews.

**Motion.** Little. The status line changes; a chip appears; the avatar sways. No spinners except a small one next to the status.

## What nanoMuse does with it

| Muse | nanoMuse | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Near-white / near-black, one blue | The same palette: `bg`, `surface-2`, `fg`, `muted`, accent `#0064d4`; dark mode by `prefers-color-scheme` | `web/src/index.css`, `android/…/values/colors.xml` |
| Optimistic | [Figtree](https://github.com/erikdkennedy/figtree) (OFL), bundled; close in proportions and warmth | `web/public/fonts/` |
| Grey / light-blue bubbles, chips for tool use, cards for approvals | The same; chips open to the tool call, cards carry the summary the Sentinel wrote and the scope buttons (once, this conversation, always; on the phone once, this chat, always) | `web/src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx`, `web/src/components/` |
| The plush doll that changes pose | The **red panda**, an SVG drawn live with a pose per state; six plush dolls (Sunny, Moss, Sky, Fox, Bolt, Plum) and an emoji as alternatives | `web/src/components/RedPanda.tsx`, `web/public/avatars/` |
| Name and status under the avatar; tap for the sheet | The same header; the sheet has the avatar large, the status, *Stop*, four buttons (approvals, activity, permissions, upcoming) and rows for memory, skills, connections, settings | `web/src/components/MuseSheet.tsx` |
| Five-icon floating bar | The same five: Chat, Feed, Ideas, Goals, Library | `web/src/App.tsx` |
| Little motion | Breathing / sway / hop for the dolls and the emoji; the panda's own poses; everything off under `prefers-reduced-motion` | `web/src/index.css`, `RedPanda.css` |

## The red panda

> Since 0.1.11 the default face is the bundled dragon (the same on the phone, the desktop and

> that poses from state was first drawn.

Muse's doll says "there is someone here, and it is busy" without a spinner. nanoMuse's answer is a red panda — a round head with two small ringed ears, a cream face that comes down in two cheek lobes to a dark nose, big dark eyes with a catchlight, a ringed tail — drawn as an SVG so that it can be posed from the app's state instead of swapped between photographs.

**Why this animal, drawn this way.** A giant panda is the obvious mascot and the one everyone already uses; a red panda is small, warm-coloured and curious, and reads as "a little helper" rather than "a national symbol". The drawing is simplified — few parts, big eyes, one expression change per mood — so it survives 16 px. Above that it is *2.5D*: radial gradients on the fur, body and cheeks, a sheen on the top of the head, a shade under the chin, a shadow the body sits in — the roundness a plush doll has, without a 3D render, which would not pose from CSS and would not stay a few kilobytes. It is never a real render and never an illustration with outlines; the parts are flat shapes with soft light on them.

**Three levels of detail** (`detail` on the component, chosen from `size` by `detailFor` when not given): `mark` up to 28 px is flat colour with the head scaled up to fill the plate — the logo, tab-bar and list sizes; `avatar` up to 160 px has the gradients; `hero` above that adds the sheen, the finer tail rings and the small props. The icon, the Android launcher and the MobileGym launcher are the `mark` level rendered from the same geometry (`web/src/components/redPandaShapes.ts`), which is the one place the shapes live: the component and the asset generator both read from it.

| State | What the app knows | What the panda does |
|---|---|---|
| idle | nothing running | breathes; blinks every few seconds; glances left and right; an ear twitches; the tail swings |
| working | `status.state == "working"` | sits at a small laptop and types, head nodding, eyes on the screen |
| waiting | `status.state == "waiting"` — an approval card or a question is open | one paw up, a "!" bubble bobbing beside it, a small hop |
| happy | a run just went from working to idle (3 s) or you tapped it | a bounce, an open smile, two sparkles |
| error | a tool call failed or was refused (4 s) | a shake, brows down, a drop of sweat |
| sleepy | the app is loaded but the server is unreachable | eyes closed, slow breathing, three z's |

The moods come from `web/src/mood.ts`: the status gives the pose it holds; two moments the store records — `finishedAt`, `mishapAt` — colour it briefly. Motion is CSS keyframes on SVG groups; every part is positioned by coordinates so the transforms can be animated, and `transform-box: view-box` with an explicit origin keeps the pivots where they belong. `still` freezes it for lists and pickers; `prefers-reduced-motion` stops all of it.

The same drawing, reduced to the head, is the logo: `web/public/icon.svg` and `mark.svg`, the PWA icons, the README cover, the Android adaptive launcher (a forest-green plate; the head flat, no gradients, because launcher masks and themed icons flatten everything anyway; a monochrome silhouette with the eyes, nose and mouth punched out for themed icons and the status bar) and the launcher icon of the MobileGym app. `npm run mascot:assets` in `web/` writes the vectors from `redPandaShapes.ts`, `npm run site:mascot` renders the six moods for the website, and `python scripts/mascot_png.py` rasterises the PWA icons and the cover — nothing is drawn twice, so the copies cannot drift apart. `RedPanda.test.tsx` holds a snapshot of the flat head, the silhouette and the idle hero; a change to the drawing has to update it on purpose.

## Colour and type, in numbers

| Token | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| `bg` | `#fcfcfc` | `#181819` |
| `surface` | `#ffffff` | `#202022` |
| `surface-2` | `#f2f2f4` | `#2a2a2d` |
| `border` | `#e7e7ea` | `#333337` |
| `fg` | `#111112` | `#ffffff` |
| `muted` | `#6b6b71` | `#9d9da4` |
| `accent` | `#0064d4` | `#1793ff` |
| user bubble | `#d8e9ff` | `#1c3d66` |

The panda: fur `#d8632e` lit to `#ee8a4c` and shaded to `#9e3f18`, deep fur `#bf4f23` (ears, tail rings, paws), cream `#fff4e6` from `#fffaf2` to `#f3dfc6` at the cheeks, markings `#2a1a14` with an eye highlight `#4a302a`, blush `#f4a0a0`; the plate behind it in the app `#dcebdc`, the logo plate `#2f7a5a`. The `mark` level uses only the base colours.

Figtree throughout, set with Tailwind's scale: 15 px in bubbles, 12–13 px for status lines and captions, 17–20 px semibold for titles.

## Identity: the name comes first

Muse opens by asking what to call it, and the name is then everywhere — the header, the notifications, the way it talks about itself. nanoMuse does the same:

- **First run is a checklist**, not a slideshow: three points about what it is (it does things for you; it keeps working when the app is closed; it asks you first where it matters), then three items — *meet your nanoMuse*, *add a model*, *connect mail, calendar, contacts* (optional) — ticked as they are done, with *Start* locked until a model answers. A reload mid-way keeps the ticks, because they are read from what was saved, not from the page.
- **The naming page**: 1–20 characters, empty falls back to `nanoMuse`; six suggested names as chips (three Chinese, three English) and a shuffle; the avatar; a one-line tagline under the name (≤ 60 characters); then how it talks — a **tone** (formal / casual / playful / concise), **how much it says** (short / detailed / bullet points), free text for anything else, and what it should call you. Each of these is its own paragraph in the system prompt (`Profile` in `nanomuse/server/service.py`), so a tone can be changed without touching the free text.
- **The name is threaded through**, not decorated: the header and the greeting, approval and permission copy ("Actions {name} wants to take…"), the CLI banner (`nanoMuse v0.1.0 · Momo`), the MobileGym bridge's titles, Settings ("You and Momo"). Where the product is meant — the app, the docs, the README — it stays *nanoMuse*.
- **Bring your own key, no account with us.** The model form lists providers grouped by protocol (OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions · Responses API · local or your own endpoint) with vendor subtitles, a masked key with a reveal toggle, a *Get a key from …* link per vendor, a Base URL that gains `/v1` when it has no path, and endpoints that need no key at all (Ollama, or a custom one with *No key* ticked). The endpoint's own `/models` is asked for the list; a static catalogue stands in when it cannot be reached; a model typed by hand is never replaced. **There is no OAuth subscription login** and none is planned for 1.0: a login through us would make nanoMuse the account holder between you and the vendor, which is the one relationship this project exists to avoid.

## Where nanoMuse differs on purpose

- **The phone's screen is visible.** Muse never shows you a screenshot; nanoMuse's phone steps are rows in the chat (`phone_act: tap "发送" …`) and the finger overlay shows on the phone itself, because a user should be able to see what a hand on their phone is doing.
- **A brake you can reach.** While nanoMuse operates the phone, a capsule sits over the app the whole time — the red panda, the step in progress, and one red **Stop**. One tap, no menu; it ends the step in flight and refuses the next ones, and the agent asks instead of carrying on. Muse's phone work happens in a cloud VM you cannot see into; on your own phone the hand must be stoppable by the hand's owner. The screen is also the *last* rung: a skill, a fetch or the browser goes first, and the Activity view shows how often the screen was needed.
- **Approvals name the scope.** Muse asks yes / no; nanoMuse's card offers *once*, *this conversation*, *always* — the same middle scope on the phone, the web app and the terminal and lists the grants under *Permissions*, each with a revoke button.
- **Everything has a plain-text form.** The same agent runs in a terminal (`nanomuse chat`) with the same approvals, and every screen is backed by a documented REST + WebSocket API, so another front-end can drive it.
- **The mascot is a drawing, not a photograph.** It costs a few kilobytes, poses from state, and can be printed on a sticker.
