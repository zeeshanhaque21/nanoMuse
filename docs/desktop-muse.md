The desktop app here is **DeepSeek Harness plus the `dsh-nanomuse` bundle**
([harness.md](harness.md)). dsh brings the loop, the tools and a complete web app with
seats a plugin can take; the bundle takes the seats that make the window look and
behave like Muse, hides what Muse does not have, and adds what the phone app has that
Muse does not — the account on every device, Reach, an open model layer.

## The window

**Muse.** One window. A narrow icon rail on the far left, a column of chats next to it,
the conversation in the middle. The agent's face and name sit *above* the conversation,
centred, with a one-line status under the name that changes as it works ("thinking",
"looking at the screen", "generating options"). The composer at the bottom has an
attach button and a microphone; while the agent works the send button becomes a stop
square. Light, dark and system themes, an accent colour, system typography; nothing
decorative, every surface a flat tone one step from its neighbour.

**nanoMuse on dsh.** The same window, screen for screen, from dsh's `sidebar` seat and a
stylesheet over the harness's stable DOM hooks (`data-composer-card`,
`data-chat-flow-kind`, `data-approval-key`…):

- The rail, in Muse's order: Chats (a dot while the agent works), Search, Feed (a dot
  for posts you have not seen), Ideas, Goals, Library, Devices; a spacer; the hamburger
  at the foot (Schedules and the harness's other panels live in its menu). No face on
  the rail — as in Muse, the face is the pinned header and the profile
  panel. On macOS the window has no title bar: the traffic lights sit over the rail's
  empty top, which is a drag handle, and full screen takes the clearance away. Windows
  gets the same frameless window with the system's own caption buttons drawn over the
  top right (`titleBarOverlay`, recoloured with the theme); Linux keeps the window
  manager's bar, since there is no portable overlay there.
- The chats column: a *Search* field with a *···* menu (archived chats), **Main chat**
  — one session that stays at the top, the first one or the one you chose with *Make
  main chat* — and **Side chats** with a *+*: every other session, pinned first, each
  with a *···* for *Make main chat*, *Pin*, *Rename* (inline), *Archive*. A blank
  session reads *New chat*; a dot marks a running one, a mark one that waits for you.
  It collapses to the rail alone.
- Above the conversation, in the harness's `conversation.header.leading` seat, the face
  and name are pinned at the top centre with the status chip: *connected* / *not signed
  in* / *thinking…* / *Hands · step N · what it is doing* / *Reach · step N · on Laptop
  B: …* / *waiting for you*; a *Stop* button beside it while a turn runs. The chip tints
  while the agent works and while it waits for an answer. Clicking the face opens the
  profile panel. At the top right, *Invite* (with an account), then the harness's
  right-sidebar toggle; the harness's own title row, tabs (*Conversation* / *Trace*)
  and session actions are hidden — the chat rows carry rename, pin and archive.
- The conversation: your messages in bubbles toned from the accent on the right, the
  agent's in large-radius grey bubbles on the left, timestamps and the per-message
  actions on hover only; an empty chat has no greeting — the composer waits at the
  bottom, as in Muse, with the workspace and preset row above it.
- The composer is one pill: *+* (attach), *Message*, the send disc (the stop square
  while a turn runs). The harness's model picker, permission mode and plan toggle are
  hidden from it — the model lives in Settings → Models and the default permission mode
  in General, as in Muse — and come back with *Show DeepSeek Harness controls* under
  General. The microphone appears when the harness's voice input is switched on in
  Plugins (Settings → Dictation says how).
- Theme: the harness's light and dark palettes are overridden to Muse's tones (`#f9f9f9`
  surfaces, `#e3e4e6` agent bubbles in the light; `#171717` with `#242424` bubbles and
  `#2b2b2b` fields in the dark) and the accent follows the face's colour on the account,
  so a face coloured on the phone colours the desktop too. The desktop shell paints the
  window in the same base colour, so a resize never flashes white in the dark.

## The first run

**Muse.** Sign in (a phone number, an SMS code — "sign in or create an account"), a
loading page, then three full-window pages with ‹ › top right and a dots pager: *Allow
Muse to use your computer?* (accessibility for clicking and typing; screen recording
for screenshots — each row with an *Allow* button that becomes a green check, fine
print, *Skip* under the card that turns into a blue *Continue* once both are allowed),
*Allow Muse to access your files and local apps?* (a *Full Disk Access* status pill, a
list of local apps each with a read-only/… dropdown, *Continue*), *Turn on voice input*
(the microphone, *Allow*, *Skip*). Then the main window with the agent's introduction in
the chat, a card to pick its name, and a connector recommendation.

**nanoMuse on dsh.** The phone's pages (`FirstRunSetup` on Android), full-window, in
the harness's `settings.onboarding` seat (we take the shipped step's id, so a fresh
install meets the agent instead of being asked for a DeepSeek key). The host keeps the
state in `$DSH_HOME/nanomuse/firstrun.json` (`src/firstrun.ts`) — *done* once Start was
pressed, the permissions page seen, which source answers — so the pages are never skipped
on a fresh install and never shown twice:

1. **Welcome** — the face, *Welcome to nanoMuse*, the three feature rows (chat, hands,
   reach), the community notice, one blue *Sign in* pill and *Use my own API key*. Sign-in
   is the phone's: *Phone number or e-mail*, the code boxes that verify themselves on the
   sixth digit, *Try another way* for a password (`/v1/auth/code`, `/v1/auth/verify`,
   `/v1/auth/login`).
2. **Set a password** (a fresh account only; *Later* skips it).
3. **Which model answers** — the Cloud account's models, or your own key.
4. **Choose models** (own key only) — opens Settings → Models beside the page and waits
   for a key; *Skip for now*.
5. **Allow nanoMuse to use your computer?** (macOS only) — *Accessibility* and *Screen
   Recording* rows, each with *Allow* that asks the system through the desktop shell and
   turns into a green check as the system grants it (polled, and again when the window gets
   focus or the page becomes visible — one hook, `permissions.ts`, behind every place that
   shows a permission); once *Allow* has been pressed the button reads *Open System
   Settings*. Only **nanoMuse Desktop** has to be switched on: macOS attributes the bundled
   runtime's captures and events to the app that started it, so there is no second entry to
   hunt for. For *Screen Recording* the shell makes one capture attempt before it opens the
   pane, so nanoMuse is on the pane's list, and when the permission is granted while the app
   runs a dialog says macOS applies it only to freshly started apps, with *Restart now*
   (`relaunch` over the bridge). *Try it* rows — a test screenshot, a mouse move — and the
   runtime row say whether it works, and a black capture gets its own notice with *Relaunch*.
   On Linux and Windows the page is skipped.
6. **Meet <name>** — the face, *Start*.

Start binds the **main chat** (the agent's own folder, `~/nanoMuse`, registered as a
workspace so the composer is live) as the **first conversation**, the phone's
`FirstConversation`: the app speaks first — three scripted lines, no tokens, never in the
model's history — and asks what to call you. From there the model does the talking and
reports what happened in a small `nanomuse-naming` block at the end of its reply (the
address, its name suggestions, the name it got); the chat shows the suggestions as the
naming card (*NamingCard*, a tap or a typed name), and the phase moves on that block and
on nothing else — a reply without one means the person talked about something else, the
model helped and steered back. When the agent has its name the first run is over: the
Feed's first day is written, the daily routine is set.

Help & support → *See the first run again* reopens the pages on purpose (the first
conversation does not repeat).

## The profile and the face

**Muse.** The face at the top opens a profile panel on the right: a large avatar with a
pen (*change avatar* / *edit name*), tabs for the profile, the approval log (what was
allowed, when, "allowed for this task" / "always allowed"), activity, more. A new face
is drawn in the chat: four candidates in a grid, pick one, the agent confirms in words.

**nanoMuse on dsh.** The face at the top opens the agent's page — the phone's
`AgentProfileScreen`, 310 px on the right beside the chat (the chat makes room; × or
Escape closes it): the avatar at 86 px with a pen — **Change avatar** puts the phone's
words in the composer ("Change your avatar to …", the chat flow below), **Edit name**,
**Avatar studio…** (the dragon, an emoji on a colour, or a drawn face, written to the
account and worn on every device) — the name, *online* / *Not signed in* / *Offline* or
what the agent is doing right now, a share button (a card with the face and the name, as
a picture to save or copy), and a segmented control of four tabs: **Activity** (the
sessions and the hub's notices, *Today* and *Earlier*), **Approvals** (the per-app
*Always allow* grants with **Revoke**, *Manage permissions* → Settings → Computer use,
then what you allowed or rejected on the approval cards, with when; kept on this
computer), **Daily** (the routines; *Manage routines* opens the harness's schedules
panel), **Soul & memory** — what the agent remembers about you, one line each: a
field to add one, × to forget one, *Import memory* (Muse's sheet: paste what another
assistant knew, one line per memory), and the agent's description when the account has
one. The agent writes memory itself with the `remember` tool when you tell it something
you will expect it to know next time, and every chat's prompt carries the list back
(`rooms.json`, this computer only). *Change look* has the dragon, an emoji on a colour,
and **Draw one** — the avatar studio: describe the character, pick a style (Muse's
vinyl-toy look by default), see what it costs against today's allowance, *Draw four*,
and the four candidates come up in a 2×2 grid with *Option 1–4*; *This one* draws the
other poses from the pick (working, waiting, happy, oops) and the new look is on, for
every device of the account. The pictures come from the account's image model through
the relay (`/v1/images/generations`, `/v1/images/edits`), the browser squares each
still to 512 px WebP, and the host writes the face to the account (`PUT /v1/me/profile`
with the `face` map) and pulls it back under `faces/<id>/`. The prompts are the
runtime's, so a face drawn on the phone or here comes out alike.

**A new look from the chat** is the phone's `AvatarFlow`, word for word: "change your
avatar to an orange cat with a scarf", "把你的形象换成一只橘猫", "become a robot" (the
same regular expressions, `src/avatar-flow.ts`) are caught before they are sent; a card
above the composer says what four pictures will cost against today's allowance (the
phone's `FaceCostDialog`), *Draw* brings the four candidates up numbered in a 2×2 grid,
and you pick by clicking or in words — "the second one", "第三个", "regenerate" — then
*Finalizing* draws the other poses, the look goes on for every device, *Share avatar*
offers the card. Once it is on, the host leaves the phone's memory line (`- <date>: the
user changed my avatar to "…"`) and asks the agent to say so in one sentence and write
the `nanomuse-avatar` fence, which the chat shows as a small card with the new face. The
agent's own `draw_new_look` still opens the studio for anything it wants to propose.

**The face moves.** Muse's avatar is animated per state; here the dragon's four states
(idle, working, waiting, happy) are the phone app's short clips
(`assets/dragon-<state>.mp4`), played silently in a loop wherever the face is 44 px or
larger — the header, the profile panel, the stage's cursor marker — with the still as
the poster, and the still alone below that size, when the system asks for reduced
motion, or where a list wants a quiet picture. A drawn face gets clips of its own, as on
the phone: four 4-second clips — idle, working, waiting, happy — drawn from the face by
`wan2.2-i2v-flash` through the relay or your own Bailian key (`src/video.ts`,
`src/motion.ts`; the phone's prompts word for word), kept under `avatar/motion/` on this
computer and served by the faces route (`/face/<id>/<state>.webp|mp4`), played in the
header, the sidebar and the capsule. *Settings → Media* has *Animate the avatar after a
change* (on by default), *Make / Redo clips* and the models used; the studio's cost
estimate counts the clips. Until the clips are there, or with the setting off, a drawn
face and an emoji move the way CSS can: a slow breath while idle, a sway while the agent
works, a small hop when it waits for you.

## Computer use

**Muse.** The controlled screen is shown inside the window as a dimmed live stage: an ×
to stop top-left, take-over controls top-right, a caption bottom-left saying what was
just done ("typed · <app>", "pressed ↵ · <app>"), the face as the cursor marker. Inline
permission cards in the chat — *allow <name> to take a screenshot?* / *write a file?* —
with *Allow (this task)*, *Always allow*, *Deny*.

**nanoMuse on dsh.** Hands are the runtime's `computer_screen` / `computer_act` over
MCP, so what the model sees is the screenshot it asked for and the status chip says
*Hands · step N · click "Save"* while it works. The harness's approval card is restyled
into Muse's permission card — a shield, the headline, the detail, *Allow once* in blue
first and *Reject* in grey — and every answer is written to the agent page's
*Approvals* tab; the Sentinel's reasons ([sentinel.md](sentinel.md)) are in the
headline. The same question is on the **stage** while the hands work — *Allow once*,
*Always in <app>* (for the hands' tools; the app is the window title's first part), *Deny*
(the host's `ApprovalDesk` sits first in the `approval/request` waterfall and answers
for the card) — and on the **capsule**, a small always-on-top window the shell shows
when the nanoMuse window is not in front, so you can answer from wherever you are.
*Always in <app>* writes a `computer_app:<app>` grant: the hands' tools in that app are
allowed without asking until you revoke the grant, on the agent page or under Settings →
Computer use → *Always allowed*. Settings → **Computer use** shows the two macOS
permissions with *Allow* and *Open System Settings* (through the desktop shell; the
first time the hands are about to start, the shell asks for them in order with a word on
why, the phone's and Codex's way — Accessibility, then Screen Recording for nanoMuse
Desktop, which since 0.1.36 is the binary that captures and clicks; the bundled
`nanomuse` runtime only needs them when it runs without the shell), *Keep the screen
awake while it works* (the shell holds a power-save
blocker while a session runs) and the note that anything that sends, pays or deletes is
asked first.

**Holds — whose turn it is.** When the agent needs you (a password, a captcha, a choice
it should not make) it calls `computer_act` with `action: "hand_over"` and a `reason`;
the host opens a *hold* (contract C1: `{type:"hold", tool:"computer", status:"on",
by:"agent", reason}`), the stage says **Your turn — <reason> — Done**, the capsule says
it outside the window, and the tool call waits (up to ten minutes) until you press
**Done**. **I'll take it** on the stage opens a hold yourself (`POST
/nanomuse/cloud/holds`) so the agent pauses before its next hands call while you use the
mouse; *Done* resumes. Questions keep *Open*. Stop (the square) still cancels the turn.

**The operator.** The hands themselves are the shell's (`src/operator.ts`, a port of
UI-TARS-desktop's `NutJSOperator` on `@computer-use/nut-js`): the screenshot through
Electron's `desktopCapturer` at the display's size, the pointer moved straight to the
point and left there 100 ms before the click, drags, scrolls, typing through the
clipboard for anything beyond ASCII, the hotkey table (`ctrl` is ⌘ on a Mac). The
runtime's `nanomuse mcp` reaches them over a loopback HTTP server the shell starts per
launch (`NANOMUSE_OPERATOR_URL` / `NANOMUSE_OPERATOR_TOKEN` in its environment, which
the preset passes through to the MCP server), so the model's coordinates — pixels of
the picture it was shown — are mapped once to the operator's screen pixels and land
where it pointed, on a scaled display as on a plain one
([gui.md](gui.md#hands-on-the-computer-the-picture-is-the-unit)). Without the shell
(`nanomuse` run on its own) the runtime falls back to `pyautogui` / `xdotool`.

**The glow.** While the hands run, the shell puts a transparent, click-through,
always-on-top window over the whole display (UI-TARS's ScreenMarker): a slow animated
gradient along the edge — amber while a hold is on — the agent's face as a small
cursor sprite where the hands last pointed, with the step's words under it, and the
**prediction marker** at the exact point the operator acted on: a turning red dashed
ring with a dot in the middle and the action's name beside it, a dashed line from start
to end for a drag, fading 1.6 s after the action. The marker comes from the operator
itself (its own fractions of the display), not from the client's reading of the tool
call, so it is where the click went. It cannot take focus or a click, it is gone 400 ms
after the hands stop, and it, the capsule and the nanoMuse window itself while the hands
run all have `setContentProtection(true)`, so none of them is in the screenshots the
runtime takes — on Linux, where content protection does nothing, the glow steps out of
the way for the instant of the capture instead.

**The live stage** is Muse's, picture-in-picture over the chat (bottom right and 400 px
to begin with; drag it anywhere, resize it from the bottom-right corner, and the place
is remembered in `prefs.stage` and kept inside the window): the latest screenshot the
agent took, dimmed while it works, × top-left to put it away,
*Expand* top-right (the frame in a sheet), a **Take over** pill while a step runs (it
cancels the session's turn — the agent lets go, your mouse is yours), a caption bottom-
left — *looking at the screen · nanoMuse*, *clicked "Save" · Finder*, *typed "hello" ·
WeChat*, *pressed ⌘ S · Pages* — and the agent's face as the cursor marker, with a
ripple, where it last clicked. The host keeps one frame in memory and no history: a
`tools/execute` middleware around the hands' calls takes the picture out of the MCP
result (`computer_screen` returns it; `computer_act` returns the screen after the
action) with the window title and size from the first line, and `GET
/nanomuse/cloud/stage/frame?seq=N` serves it to the browser half; ten minutes after the
last step the frame is dropped. When the agent looks at a *phone* through Reach
(`device_screen`), the same stage shows that screen with the device's name — that is
what the phone app shows while its own Hands work ([gui.md](gui.md)), seen from here.

## Settings

**Muse.** A dialog with a sidebar: General (account, usage, language, appearance with
mode and accent, run on startup, show in menu bar, floating button, shortcuts, About
with version and check for updates) · Connectors · Computer use (the two macOS
permissions, keep screen awake, ask every time / always allow / always deny for computer
control and browser automation, blocked apps) · File system access · Dictation · Wallet
· Secure storage · Permissions · Message channels · Devices · Data controls (privacy,
import memory, download your data, reset) · Help · Legal · Sign out.

**nanoMuse on dsh.** The same shape, from the harness's `sidebar.settings` seat with its
stock General plugin switched off in the bundle layer:

- **General** — in Muse's order: the **account card** (the masked identifier or *Sign
  in*, opening the Account page), **Usage** (the plan and its bar — *Member* /
  *Unlimited*, or the free allowance with what is left and *Upgrade*), **Language** (the
  harness's own row in our card), **Appearance** (the harness's light / dark / system
  switch; the accent follows the face), **App behavior** when the desktop shell is there —
  *Open at login* (a login item; a freedesktop autostart entry on Linux), *Show in the
  menu bar* / *system tray* (an icon with *Open nanoMuse*, *New chat*, *Quit*), *Quick
  chat with ⌥ Space* (Ctrl+Alt+Space elsewhere: the window comes up with a fresh chat
  and the composer focused; pressed while it is in front, it steps aside) — kept in
  `desktop.json` under the app's home; **Shortcuts** (*Quick Chat* with its combination —
  *Change* records the next one you press, Esc cancels, *Default* puts the platform's back,
  and a line says so when another app already holds it — and the keyboard reference); **About** (nanoMuse, built on DeepSeek Harness, the licence, and two version
  lines that are always there: *nanoMuse Desktop <app> · harness <bundle> — installed*
  and *Latest 0.1.x — you have it* / *0.1.x is out — Update* / *Could not check — tap to
  try again*; the check reads this fork's GitHub releases first and, only when one is
configured, a mirror index
  second, once a day); and *Developer*: *Show DeepSeek
  Harness controls* (the model picker, the modes, the workspace browser in place of the
  chats column). The harness's other rows (permission presets, font size, link opening,
  Enter to send, performance, session log) live under *Advanced → Harness*.
- **Account** (under *Advanced*) — the nanoMuse account: sign in or the masked
  identifier, the allowance, the look, the models, *Open Devices*.
- **Media** — the models that draw the face and its clips (the relay's, or your own
  Bailian key), *Animate the avatar after a change*, *Make / Redo clips* with the state
  of each of the four, and the cost note.
- **Models**, **Agents** — the harness's pages, unchanged, under *Advanced*.
- **Connectors** — Muse's catalogue shape: a search field, category chips (*All*,
  *Built in*, *Work*, *Talk*, *Files*, *Developer*, *Data*, *Design*, *Money*,
  *Search*, *Infrastructure*…), **Connected** rows first and then the catalogue, each row
  with the service's brand mark on a white tile (the marks are
  [simple-icons](https://simpleicons.org/), CC0, written into
  `src/client/brand-marks.ts` by `scripts/brand-marks.mjs`; a letter tile where there is
  none) and *Connect* at the
  end; a detail per connector with what it can do — its tools as the server describes
  them, **one switch per tool** — what gates it (the permission preset, the Sentinel for
  the hands and the mailbox), the vendor's documentation, and *Disconnect* (asked
  twice). Three kinds of row:
  - **Built in** is what the agent can really reach: *Hands — this computer* (on when
    the runtime answered, with the reason when it did not), *Mailbox*, *Calendar*,
    *Address book* (the runtime's connectors, on when their tools arrive through
    `nanomuse mcp`), *Reach — your other devices*, *Web*, *Files*, *Terminal*, the
    rooms, *Schedule*. *Connect* on the mailbox, the calendar or the address book opens a
    **consent sheet** in Muse's manner — what the agent gets, who decides, where the
    credentials live — followed by the steps (`nanomuse vault set …`, the `config.toml`
    lines, restart) with copy buttons; there is no sign-in button on purpose, the
    credentials stay in your own vault.
  - **Services** — the catalogue (`src/connectors-catalogue.ts`, seventy-five remote
    MCP servers: Notion, Linear, Atlassian, Asana, GitHub, GitLab, Sentry, Vercel,
    Cloudflare, Supabase, Stripe, PayPal, QuickBooks, Figma, Miro, Canva, Dropbox, Box,
    Hugging Face, DeepWiki…), each
    with its address and how it lets a client in. *Connect* asks the server itself
    (`initialize`): an **open** server is connected at once; a server that speaks **MCP
    authorization** opens the sign-in page in the system browser — protected-resource
    and authorization-server metadata, dynamic client registration (RFC 7591), PKCE,
    `resource` (RFC 8707), the loopback callback at `127.0.0.1:38417/oauth/callback`,
    refresh before expiry — and the sheet waits with *Open again*, *Try again* and
    *Start over* (a fresh registration, for a server that forgot ours); a server that
    wants a **key** asks for it in a sheet that says where the vendor hands it out. A
    service whose authorization server registers no clients (GitHub, Slack, Discord,
    HubSpot, Render, Bitrise, PagerDuty, Box — `clientIdRequired` in the catalogue, and
    any address that turns out that way) gets a sheet of its own: make an OAuth app at
    the vendor's developer page (linked), give it our callback address (shown, copy
    button), paste the client id and, if there is one, the secret; the id is kept like a
    registration, so the next sign-in there does not ask. The
    rows under the search field also search the public **MCP Registry**
    (`registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`) once two characters are typed, and **Connect by
    address** takes any Streamable HTTP URL, with a key or a pre-registered OAuth client
    under *More options*. Credentials live in `$DSH_HOME/nanomuse/connectors.json`,
    this computer only, and never reach the model: the agent's `dsh-mcp-client` is
    pointed at a **loopback proxy** (`/c/<id>/mcp`, guarded by a secret header) that
    adds the token or key, refreshes it, filters `tools/list` to the switched-on tools
    and refuses `tools/call` on the rest; the tools appear as `mcp__<service>__<tool>`
    and the preset row `nanomuse-connectors-tools` mounts one client per connection and
    follows the page (connect, switch, disconnect — no restart). A connection whose
    refresh is refused turns to *Needs sign-in* with *Sign in again*; a key is replaced
    in place.
  - **Preset** — every MCP server configured in the agent preset by hand
    (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` rows), read-only here, with *Add a connector*
    opening the preset.

  What Muse has and this does not: the per-action permission dropdowns (ours is the
  permission preset plus the tool switches), and services whose MCP server wants a
  client registered with the vendor beforehand (Zapier, Heroku…) — those are in the
  catalogue as *key* or *address* rows, not as a sign-in.
- **Computer use** — the system permissions (macOS), keep awake, the risk note.
- **File system access** — the folders the agent uses (home, the Library, Downloads,
  nanoMuse's own files; each opens in the file manager), the rules (reading anything you
  name; writing under the chat's permission preset, asking outside its folder; the
  sandbox), and *Full Disk Access* on macOS.
- **Dictation** — the harness's own voice input (local SenseVoice; switched on in
  Plugins, a microphone appears beside Send, audio stays on the computer), the microphone
  permission on macOS, and how to use the system's dictation into the composer.
- **Devices** — this computer (its name, the remote-control switch that lets the phone
  run things here) and the other devices on the account, online dots, *Forget*.
- **Permissions** — one page that says what the agent may touch (computer use, files,
  microphone, connectors, other devices with the remote-control state), each row opening
  the page with the switch; how it asks (the permission presets, from the chip above
  the composer); the recent approvals.
- **Wallet**, **Secure storage**, **Message channels** — Muse's pages, with what is true
  here: no payment method is held and nothing is bought from a chat (the agent stops at a
  checkout and the usage lives under General); which files on this computer hold what
  (the account's login, the agent's profile, the rooms and documents, the faces — each
  with its path, *Show the folder*) and what is never kept (the system keychain, your
  passwords); which channels reach the agent (this desktop, the browser, the invite link
  when signed in, your other devices) and that no third-party messenger is wired in.
- **Data controls** — *We take your privacy seriously* with the privacy policy, *Help
  improve nanoMuse's AI models* (the relay's switch, with how many turns it kept and
  *Delete*), as on every other app; then *On this computer*: **Import memory**,
  **Download your agent data** (a zip in Downloads — the account snapshot without the
  sign-in token, the look and faces, the rooms, memory, and the chats as the harness
  keeps them; shown in the file manager) and **Reset** (memory, the rooms and the local
  look go, the account signs out; the chats stay).
- **Help & support** — the docs, the site, discussions, report an issue, the version.
- **Legal** — the licence, the Meta trademark notice, the acknowledgements (DeepSeek
  Harness, OpenMinis), the privacy policy and the terms.
- **Advanced** — every page another plugin registers (the harness's plugin manager,
  archived sessions…), grouped at the bottom so they are there and out of the way.
- **Sign out** at the foot while signed in. Signing out (or *Reset*) takes the window
  back to the welcome sheet, the way a fresh install starts.

Wallet, secure storage and message channels are not there: the Cloud has no wallet —
members have an allowance ([cloud.md](cloud.md#allowance)) — nanoMuse keeps no
passwords for the agent, and messages reach you through the phone app's notifications
rather than a messenger.

## The rail's other rooms — Feed, Ideas, Goals, Library

**Muse.** Four more rooms on the rail: a *Feed* of posts the agent makes (digests with
pictures, like / discuss, a text that steers future posts); *Ideas*, proactive
suggestions by life area, each a card with why, what it includes, how it works, *start
now*; *Goals* with categories, running automations (cron-like) and a dated timeline;
*Library*, everything generated — documents (a markdown editor), web artefacts, images,
videos, podcasts, system files.

**nanoMuse on dsh.** The four rooms are on the rail, in Muse's order (Chats, Search,
Feed, Ideas, Goals, Library, Devices), each one `main` panel of the harness's layout,
so the chat column stays where it is and a room opens in its place. One host service
(`nanomuse-rooms`, `src/rooms.ts`) keeps them in `$DSH_HOME/nanomuse/rooms.json`,
serves `/nanomuse/rooms/*` and streams changes to the browser half:

- **Feed** — posts the agent writes for you in a hidden chat, from your *feed
  instructions*, your goals and the profile: title, Markdown body with links inline, a
  picture when the page it read had one, ♡ and **Discuss** (a side chat opened on the
  post). The room opens on the phone's intro card (*About the feed* — what the posts are
  made of, *Edit preferences*, *Got it*); while it is empty the words say when the daily
  routine runs (*Every day at 08:00 I read what I remember about you …*) with **Write it
  now**; the first day is written when the first conversation ends, and the daily routine
  (08:00, a schedule you can move or switch off under the sliders) is created the first
  time the room opens. A dot on the rail marks posts newer than your last visit. The agent
  can also post from any chat with `feed_post`.
- **Ideas** — the phone's curated list (`assets/ideas.{en,zh}.json`, the same 24 items
  in six sections: Travel, Work, Everyday, Learning, Family & friends, More ideas), each
  row an emoji, a first-person pitch and a line of detail; a row opens a sheet that says
  what trying it creates — *Starts a conversation*, *Creates a routine · 08:00*,
  *Creates a goal* — with **Send to chat** (the idea's words in the composer, for you to
  finish), **Create routine** (a daily schedule at the idea's time in a chat of its own;
  *Routine created — set the time and details*) or **Start goal** (the goal
  conversation, seeded with the idea); tried ideas get a green check, ⋯ hides one.
- **Goals** — *● Tracking* list with categories (health, relationships, money, career,
  interests, productivity), the agent's one-line status, a progress bar once it has
  reported one and a *Needs attention* flag. **Create goal › <category>** is the
  phone's flow: "I'd like to create a Health goal." goes into the chat you are in (a
  fresh one when it is busy) with the phone's shaping note; the agent asks at most three
  short questions, one at a time — what, why and by when, how often to check — and then
  writes one `nanomuse-goal` fence, which the chat shows as a *Goal created* card (title,
  why, steps, *Checks daily at 09:00* / *every N hours*, *See in Goals*) and the host
  turns into the goal: that chat becomes its home, and a check is scheduled there with
  the harness's schedule plugin (*Time to check on this goal: …*, *First time round: …*).
  Every check — and any turn where progress changed — ends with a `nanomuse-goal-update`
  fence (`goal_id`, `progress`, `status` on_track / attention / done, `note`): a *Goal
  update* card in the chat with the bar and the note, the goal's status, progress and
  timeline updated; the agent may also call `goals_room_update`. *Type it out* in the
  menu still creates a goal from your own words; *Check in* runs a check now.
- **Library** — shelves (All, Documents, Web; Media: Images, Videos, Podcasts; System
  files at the foot), *Select*, *+ Create…* (a brief → a chat that writes the file under
  `~/nanoMuse/Library` — `构件` in Chinese — with the workspace-write preset), *Recent*
  and a card grid; a viewer and a Markdown editor for text, pictures and media inline,
  *Open* / *Show in folder* for the rest. Everything the agent delivers with `present`
  lands here, and `library_add` lists a file without delivering it.

Rooms need a model that answers; signed out, they say so. The hidden chat the feed is
written in is archived once parsed, so the chats column stays yours. A `nanomuse-feed`
fence the agent writes in any chat (the phone's way of posting) lands in the Feed too
and shows as a *Posted to your feed* card.

## The hamburger

**Muse.** Settings; report a bug (with a screenshot attached).

**nanoMuse on dsh.** Settings (with its shortcut; a dot on it and on the ••• button
when a newer release is out), **Update to 0.1.x** when there is one (opens the release
page), **About nanoMuse** (the version line *nanoMuse Desktop <app> · harness <bundle>*,
the licence, GitHub / Releases / Docs / Issues), Keyboard shortcuts, Schedules and
the harness's other panels (Plugins and whatever else is installed), collapse / expand
the chats column, *Report a problem* — under the desktop shell a screenshot of the
window goes to Downloads and the GitHub issue page opens with the build's facts filled
in (a toast says which file to drag in); in a browser it opens the issues page.
Everything dsh has that Muse does not — the plugin manager, the panel list, archived
sessions, developer tools — is reachable from here or from Settings → Advanced and
nowhere else.

## Not in Muse, in nanoMuse

- **The account on every device.** Sign in on the phone with the same number and the
  desktop's status line counts it; *Reach* lets either side ask the other for something
  ([hub.md](hub.md)).
- **Any model, your key.** The relay's models for members, a DeepSeek key, or any
  OpenAI-compatible provider the harness supports. Settings → nanoMuse Cloud shows two rows:
  the **chat model** (the relay's `/v1/models` entries marked `for: ["chat"]`, default
  `deepseek-v4.1-flash`) and the **hands model** (`for: ["gui"]`, default
  `qwen3.8-27b`); a DeepSeek entry is shown as sighted only when its id says `v4.1`,
  `vision` or `ocr`. The hands model is written to `$DSH_HOME/nanomuse/hands.json`
  (mode 0600) and the preset passes it to the runtime at the next start.
- **Connectors on every device.** What you connected here (service, label, URL for a
  custom MCP, how it signs in, which device) is published to the account's profile
  (contract C3; never a token or a key — the host refuses any field named like one), so
  the phone and the other computers list it under *On your other devices* with
  **Connect**, and this computer lists theirs.
- **Ways to get a model, by region.** With a Chinese UI, a phone sign-in or a relay
  account in the mainland, the account page lists Bailian first and OpenRouter second;
  elsewhere the other way round, each with *Get a key*.
- **Updates.** Once a day, and on *Check for updates* in About, the host asks GitHub's
  releases API — this fork's own releases, with an optional configured mirror as fallback —
and compares versions; a
  newer one shows as a dot, an *Update to 0.1.x* menu item and a *Download* button for
  this platform's asset in About.
- **Open source, no closed component.** The bundle is GPL-3.0-or-later; the harness is
  MIT and travels with its notice; the About row says so.
