# Every device

The fourth thing that defines nanoMuse ([roadmap](roadmap.md)): one agent, and
every device you own is a pair of hands and a front door for it. This page is
the design for that stage — what every device's app looks like, what each one
can do on its own and for the others, how a task travels, and which existing
pieces each part is built from. The protocol itself is in [hub.md](hub.md);
this page is about the product shape and the code around it.

## One Muse per device, one shape

Every device runs its own Muse — the phone its OpenMinis-based agent, the
computer the Python runtime — and every one of them shows the same app. The
Android app is the reference; the others follow its shape, not its pixels:

| On every device | Android today | Computer (this stage) |
|---|---|---|
| A face with a name pill and a status line at the top of the conversation | `HomeShell`, `AgentAvatarDisc` | the web app's chat header, dragon by default |
| One main chat, side chats in a drawer | drawer | drawer on narrow windows, a sidebar on wide ones |
| Feed · Ideas · Goals · Library | bottom bar | bottom bar / sidebar |
| Approval cards in the chat, three tiers, *remember* pills | `RiskApprovalCard`, `RiskTier` | the Sentinel's card with the same labels |
| Settings → Permissions: what was remembered, by tier | `GrantsSection` | Permissions page, grants by tier |
| Settings → Hands: the screen as a hand, off by default | `Hands` | Settings → Hands (this computer's screen) |
| Devices: the account's other devices, online dots, *Remote control*, rename, forget, *ask this device* | `DevicesSection`, `ComputersScreen` | Devices page |
| The stage while the hands work: a ring where the next tap lands, a capsule with the step and **Stop** | `HandsStage`, capsule | a live *Hands* card in the chat; the window adds an overlay |
| First run: what it is, sign in with a phone number or an e-mail (free) or your own key, the Hands permissions, meet | `FirstRunSetup` | the same four pages |

## Two roles

Each device plays both, at the same time.

**An agent of its own.** It climbs the same ladder everywhere ([gui.md](gui.md)):
a skill, a CLI or an MCP server first; a page fetched with your login; the
browser; and last, when you allowed it, the device's own screen — looking at a
screenshot, deciding one action, doing it, looking again. On the phone the
shell is the app's Linux sandbox and the screen is *Hands*. On the computer the
shell is the real shell (sandboxed where the runtime can), the browser is
Playwright or the system browser, and the screen is *Hands on this computer*:
`computer_screen`, `computer_act`, `computer_task` — the phone operator's loop
with a computer under it. A click is assessed by the words under the cursor
(`label`), exactly as a tap is, and the same words (pay, transfer, send,
delete…) make it a highest-tier approval that no standing permission covers.

**Hands and a front door for the others.** Signed in to one account, the
devices meet over the hub and each one exposes what it can do as actions
(`shell`, `files`, `file.get`, `file.put`, `open`, `screen`, `notify`) and as a
target for whole tasks (`task`). Any device's agent has the others as tools:
`devices`, `device_shell`, `device_files`, `device_get`, `device_put`,
`device_open`, `device_screen`, `device_notify`, and `delegate` — a job in
words for the other device's Muse. So "find the order number on my phone, then
put it in the spreadsheet on my Mac" is one conversation: the phone's Muse
finds it with Hands, the Mac's puts it in the file, and the person who asked
sees both halves in the chat they typed in.

A device decides what it lets the others do: **Remote control** off makes it
answer `info` and nothing else, while it still drives the rest. With it on, the
person *at* the device still agrees before another device runs, reads or writes
something there — a card on that screen, *once* or *always for that device*
(a standing permission listed under Permissions like any other, revocable there).
A `task` runs under the device's own Sentinel instead; `notify` never asks. On
nanoMuse Desktop the switch is off by default and means "each device asks here";
on lets every device of the account through without the question.

## How a task travels

```
you, on the phone ──"编译一下项目，把日志发我"──▶ phone's Muse
                                                  │ delegate("desk", …)
                                                  ▼  hub: call task
                                         desk's Muse, in a side chat
                                         "From Pixel" that the desk shows live
                                                  │ tool events ─▶ phone (chips)
                                                  │ approval? ──▶ phone (card) ── approve ─▶
                                                  ▼
                                         result {text} ──▶ phone's Muse ──▶ you
```

- The **asking device's brain** runs the conversation; the target device's
  Muse runs the delegated job in a conversation of its own. Raw actions
  (`device_shell`…) skip the target's brain entirely.
- **Approvals are answered where the question was asked**: the target's
  Sentinel raises the card, the frame `event {stage:"approval"}` carries it
  back, the asker shows its usual card, and `approve` carries the answer. The
  target also shows the same card in its own side chat; the first answer wins.
  Commands typed on one device for another are judged on the typing device
  before they leave (ShellGuard on the phone, the Sentinel's assessment here).
- **Watching and taking over**: the delegated conversation is a real side chat
  on the target, so a person at that device sees it run, can type into it
  (folded into the running turn) and can press Stop. The asker sees the chips
  and the final answer; `stop` from the asker ends it too.
- Files and screenshots travel base64 in the frames; the size limits are the
  hub's.

## The computer: nanoMuse Desktop

The desktop is the Python runtime (`nanomuse serve`) with three front doors on
the same local service — the terminal (`nanomuse chat`), the browser (the web
app it serves, also reachable from the phone on the same network) and a
window. That is the shape OpenCode v2 and Codex take (a local service, a CLI
and a desktop app over it) and it is what the runtime already was; this stage
adds the hub, the Cloud account and the hands to it.

```
   nanomuse serve  ─ FastAPI + WebSocket, 127.0.0.1:8787 ─┬─ web/ (React) in a browser or on the phone
      │ MuseAgent · Sentinel · tools                        ├─ nanomuse mcp → nanoMuse Desktop (harness/, on DeepSeek Harness)
      │ nanomuse/hub  ── wss://…/v1/hub ── the other devices └─ nanomuse chat (terminal)
      │ nanomuse/computer ── mss + pyautogui: the screen as a hand
      └ nanomuse/cloud ── the nanoMuse Cloud account (e-mail code → key → models + hub)
```

- **Runtime** (`nanomuse/`): `cloud.py` signs in to nanoMuse Cloud with an
  e-mail (or phone) code, keeps the key in the vault and can make the relay the
  model provider — the same *Sign in — free* first step as on the
  phone. `hub/` is the async port of the desktop binary's hub client: one
  socket kept up, incoming actions answered by `hub/actions.py`, incoming
  `task`s run in a visible side chat with their approvals relayed, outgoing
  calls behind the `device_*` and `delegate` tools. `computer/` is the screen
  as a hand on this machine. Settings: `[cloud]`, `[hub]`, `[hands]`; all of
  them switchable from the app.
- **Web app** (`web/`): the Devices page, side chats addressed to a device,
  the approval card's tiers and *remember* pills, the Hands card with Stop,
  Settings → Hands, the Cloud sign-in in the first run and under Connections,
  the dragon as the default face. Built into `nanomuse/server/static/`.
- **Window**: from 0.1.30 the window is [nanoMuse Desktop](desktop.md) on
  DeepSeek Harness (`harness/`): the harness's Host and web app in an Electron
  shell of ours, nanoMuse's account, face, Hands and Reach as plugins, and this
  runtime bundled for the hands (`nanomuse mcp` over stdio). The Electron shell
  around this runtime and the web app (`desktop/app`, 0.1.19–0.1.29) — the
  tray, the transparent stage window that drew the ring where the hands were
  about to click, the global Stop and quick-chat shortcuts, *Start with the
  computer* — is retired; those come back on the harness's seams
  ([harness.md](harness.md), phase 7). The web app still lays itself out the
  Muse way on a wide window for anyone who opens `nanomuse serve` in a browser.
- **The standard-library binary** (`desktop/nanomuse_desktop`) stays as the
  zero-install fallback for a machine without Python; its hub code is the
  origin of `nanomuse/hub`. In time its terminal becomes a client of the
  service like the other two doors.

### Hands on this computer

`computer_task` is the phone operator with a computer under it: the same loop
(look, decide one action, act through the Sentinel, look again), the same
report, the same Stop. What differs is the dialect and the device:

- **Dialect.** The model speaks Qwen's `computer_use` shape — `left_click`,
  `double_click`, `right_click`, `left_click_drag`, `mouse_move`, `scroll`,
  `type`, `key`, `wait`, plus `open` (an app by name), `answer`, `ask_user` and
  `terminate` — with coordinates on the 0–999 grid the phone uses, so one
  vision model serves both. The reply format (Thought / Action / one
  `<tool_call>`) and the parser are the phone's.
- **Device.** Screenshots through `mss` (every platform, scaled for the
  model); actions through `pyautogui` (`pip install "nanomuse[hands]"`), with
  `xdotool` as the fallback on Linux when it is there and pyautogui is not; the
  active window's title from the platform (`xdotool` / `osascript` /
  `GetForegroundWindow`) so the card and the log say *in Firefox*, not *on the
  screen*.
- **Permissions.** macOS asks for Screen Recording and Accessibility once;
  Settings → Hands says so and opens the panes. Linux needs X11 (Wayland has
  no portable way to move the pointer yet; the page says so). Windows needs
  nothing.
- **Never** typed by the hands: passwords, PINs, card numbers, one-time codes.
  The operator asks; the person types.

## The phone

Already both roles since 0.1.12/0.1.13/0.1.17: the sandbox shell and Hands
locally, `nanomuse-pc` and the hub outward, `task` inward through the headless
chat runner. Left for this stage's Android pass, in order: the hub `approve`
reaching the RiskGate card (today a task the desk delegates is approved on the
phone's screen only), the desk's Hands events shown while it works, a
*Devices* entry in the drawer. None of it blocks the desktop work.

## The browser: a demo on a simulated phone

[nanomuse.cn/web](https://nanomuse.cn/web/) leads to the showcase: a simulated
phone in the browser (MobileGym, with the nanoMuse app brought to the front —
`demo/mobilegym/apps/nanoMuse`) and, behind it, a private nanoMuse of the
visitor's own that the showcase gateway starts for the visit — the
`ghcr.io/nano-muse/nanomuse` image on a network with no way out but the
gateway, talking with the showcase's model, gone when the visit ends. A visitor
signs in to nanoMuse Cloud first (a code to a phone or an inbox, or the
account's password; `demo/showcase/gateway/showcase_gateway/visitors.py`), so
the project knows who is trying it and the same account is there on the day
the app is installed. The page says so plainly: this is a demo, a long way from
the Android app, and where the apps are.

The earlier shape of the web — a kept Muse per Cloud account, with named
volumes and a seat on the hub like any other device (`accounts.py`,
`WEB_ENABLED=1`) — is still in the gateway for anyone who runs one, and off on
the project's server since 0.1.26. Details and the settings in
[demo/showcase/README.md](../demo/showcase/README.md).

## iOS, the web console, glasses

iOS speaks the hub (`info`, `open`, `notify`) and gets the shape later
([ios.md](ios.md)). The cloud console (`/app/`) is a front door with no hands
of its own and stays that way. Glasses are a sentence in and a sentence back,
the hands elsewhere — the hub is already enough for them.

## What is reused, and from where

- **UI-TARS-desktop** (Apache-2.0): the operator pattern — screenshot in,
  parsed action out, an `execute` per device — and the on-screen marker while
  the agent works. Not its Electron app or its model: its action space is the
  UI-TARS model's, ours is Qwen's `mobile_use` / `computer_use`.
- **OpenCode v2** (MIT): the desktop as a thin Electron shell that starts a
  local service and renders a web app against it (electron-vite,
  electron-builder, a tray, deep links later). Not its agent: it is a coding
  agent around a project directory; nanoMuse is a personal one around a person.
- **Codex** (Apache-2.0): the CLI as a first-class front door to the same
  agent, approvals in the terminal, a sandbox for commands — the runtime's
  `nanomuse chat` and the Sentinel already have that shape.
- **Qwen-Agent / MemGUI-Bench** (MIT): the `mobile_use` and `computer_use`
  dialects and the reply parser, already in `nanomuse/phone/operator.py`.
- **pyautogui**, **mss**, **xdotool**: mouse, keyboard and screenshots. No
  input library of our own.

## Debugging it all on one machine

Two runtimes and a relay on `127.0.0.1` are enough to walk a task from one
device to another and back. Nothing here needs a real account, an e-mail
provider or a phone.

```bash
# 1. the relay, in dev mode: no CLOUD_SECRET, codes go to the log; sign-up and the
#    hub are on by default. Without UPSTREAM_KEY the proxy answers 503 while sign-up
#    and the hub still work; give the relay a real key (from the environment, never
#    on the command line) if you want the Cloud model to answer.
mkdir -p /tmp/nm-dev/cloud
CLOUD_DB=/tmp/nm-dev/cloud/cloud.db CODE_SENDER=log PUBLIC_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8790 \
  PYTHONPATH=cloud .venv/bin/python -m nanomuse_cloud --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8790 \
  > /tmp/nm-dev/cloud/relay.log 2>&1 &

# 2. two runtimes, each with its own data dir, workspace and port
for d in a b; do
  mkdir -p /tmp/nm-dev/$d/home /tmp/nm-dev/$d/ws
  printf 'data_dir = "/tmp/nm-dev/%s/home"\nworkspace = "/tmp/nm-dev/%s/ws"\n\n[llm]\napi_key = ""\n\n[cloud]\nbase_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8790"\n\n[hub]\nname = "%s"\n' \
    $d $d "$([ $d = a ] && echo 'Desk A' || echo 'Laptop B')" > /tmp/nm-dev/$d/config.toml
done
# ambient provider keys would be picked up as the model — clear them for a clean first run
env -u OPENAI_API_KEY -u DASHSCOPE_API_KEY -u ANTHROPIC_API_KEY -u OPENAI_BASE_URL \
  .venv/bin/nanomuse serve -c /tmp/nm-dev/a/config.toml --no-auth --no-qr --port 8799 > /tmp/nm-dev/a/serve.log 2>&1 &
env -u OPENAI_API_KEY -u DASHSCOPE_API_KEY -u ANTHROPIC_API_KEY -u OPENAI_BASE_URL \
  .venv/bin/nanomuse serve -c /tmp/nm-dev/b/config.toml --no-auth --no-qr --port 8798 > /tmp/nm-dev/b/serve.log 2>&1 &

# 3. sign both in with the same e-mail in the first run (the code is in relay.log:
#    grep -i code /tmp/nm-dev/cloud/relay.log), pick "Use the Cloud model" on each.
# 4. (0.1.19–0.1.29) the Electron window over Desk A came from desktop/app; now open
#    http://127.0.0.1:8799/ in a browser, or sign nanoMuse Desktop in as a third device.
```

Then on Desk A: *Devices* shows Laptop B online; *Ask* (or the chip under the
chats) opens a chat *on Laptop B*; a task typed there runs on B, its tool
chips and approval cards appear in A with the device pill, an approval decided
in A closes the card on both sides, and B's answer lands in A's chat. Swap the
ports and the same happens the other way. Stop everything with
`ss -ltnp | grep ':879'` and `kill`.

## The phone, in 0.1.19

Three things the computer does are mirrored on Android since 0.1.19: the
phone's hub client reads the `tool` / `tool_result` / `approval_result` stages
(`ReachOffloadHandler`), hub `approve` frames reach `RiskGate` and the phone's
own approvals travel to the asker as `approval` events (`HubActions`), and a
*Devices* row sits in the drawer next to the chats. Still to come: the desk's
hands events (`HandsLive`) as a Hands card on the phone when the phone asked
for the task.
