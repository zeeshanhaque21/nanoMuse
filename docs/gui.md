Muse's abilities in the West come from services with APIs. Most of what a person in China does on a phone — 12306, 微信, 支付宝, 美团 — has no API a personal agent may call. nanoMuse therefore has a second pair of hands: with the *Phone* switch on, the agent can look at the phone's screen and tap, type and swipe in its apps, the way a person would. It is the same agent with the same Sentinel in front of it; GUI steps are just more tool calls.

Three things decide how this part is built:

- **Local.** The brain runs where you run it — your machine, or the phone itself in the Android build — and the screen goes to the model you configured, nobody else.
- **China first.** The default model is on 阿里云百炼 in mainland China and OpenRouter (`qwen/qwen3.8-27b`) elsewhere, the sample tasks are 12306 and 微信, the sensitive-word list is Chinese first.
- **Any app.** The operator sees the screen as a picture and taps by position. It does not need an accessibility tree, labelled buttons or a per-app integration, so a new app costs nothing — the same loop that books a train reads a chat. When the device *has* a tree (the Android app), it is sent along as a second input — small text becomes readable and a password field is known to be one — but nothing depends on it.
- **Last resort.** The screen is the fourth rung of a ladder (below): a skill, a command-line tool or an MCP server that does the thing exactly comes first, then a page fetched with the user's login, then the in-app browser. Every screen step is a model call and a picture; the agent climbs only when the rung below cannot do it, and says so before it starts.

Off by default. Nothing about the phone reaches the model until you turn it on.

## The ladder

There are four ways to reach a service, and they are tried lowest first:

| rung | how | when |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | a **skill**, a **CLI** or an **MCP server** — `feishu` through lark-cli, `amap` through its MCP server, mail, the calendar, files | whenever one exists: exact, instant, no screen |
| 2 | a **fetch with the user's login** — `browser` action=fetch, `web_fetch` | a page that shows the answer once you are signed in |
| 3 | the **in-app browser**, page by page | a site that needs clicking through, but is a site |
| 4 | the **phone's screen** — `phone_task` | what lives in an app and nowhere else: a 微信 chat, 12306's real seats, an order in 美团, a payment |

A skill says which rung it works on with `channel:` in its front matter — `api`, `cli`, `web`, `browser`, `gui` or `mixed` (`app-only` and `phone` are accepted for `gui`). A `gui` skill shows up in the agent's skill index as *[on the phone's screen]*, so the agent knows a rung-4 job when it sees one; `train-tickets` and `phone-messages` are the built-in examples. Before the first step on the screen the agent says in one line what it is about to do on the phone; if you did not ask for the phone yourself — it is climbing because the lower rungs failed — it asks first. The Activity view counts how many of a session's steps were on the screen, so you can see the ladder being kept.

## What it looks like

Ask "帮我看看明天北京到上海最早的高铁" and the agent opens 12306 on the phone, sets the stations and the date, presses 查询车票, filters 只看高铁 and reads the list back to you. Ask it to reply to someone on 微信 and it opens the chat, types the text, and **stops at the send button until you approve**. Ask for something that mixes both worlds — research on the web, a ticket in 12306, an event in your calendar — and it moves between its native tools and the screen as it goes.

In the chat every GUI step shows up as a row such as `phone_act: tap "发送" at (318,742) in 微信 (wechat)`, so you can see what it did; on the phone a ripple marks where the finger landed and a caption says what Muse is doing (see [Showing the finger](#showing-the-finger)). Afterwards `nanomuse phone traces` lists every task and `nanomuse phone trace <id> -o trace.html` renders one as a page with every screen and every tap drawn on it.

## Turning it on

In the app: *Connections → Phone*, flip the switch. In `config.toml`:

```toml
[gui]
enabled = true
```

or `NANOMUSE_GUI_ENABLED=1`. When the switch is on the agent gets three more tools (see below) and a paragraph in its system prompt about the phone that is connected. When it is off, the tools do not exist.

### The model that moves the finger

Reading a screen every step is many small calls, each with a picture in it, so the operator can use its own model, separate from the main one:

```toml
[gui]
enabled  = true
provider = "openai"                                   # or openai_responses
model    = "qwen3.8-27b"                              # must take images; a fast one that reads well is enough
base_url = "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
api_key  = "{{vault:GUI_API_KEY}}"
```

The chat model and the hands model are two settings: *Operating the screen* on *Settings → Models* (phones and desktop), the *Hands model* select on *Connections* (web console), `[gui] model` here. Leave it empty (the row's *Automatic*) and the hands follow one order:

- the chat model's provider, when it is a key of yours whose catalogue entry names a hands model on the same endpoint (Alibaba Cloud Bailian `qwen3.8-27b`, OpenRouter `qwen/qwen3.8-27b`); a model that is known to be blind (DeepSeek ids without `v4.1`, `vision` or `ocr`) is never offered for the hands;
- else, with a nanoMuse Cloud account, the relay's hands model: `qwen3.8-27b` unless the relay names another (`/v1/models` says which models are `for` `chat`, `gui` or both); the chat default there is `deepseek-v4.1-flash`, which reads pictures too, but the hands want the model trained to point at things on a screen, so the two are kept apart;
- else the chat model itself, which only works when it sees (the phones and the desktop try the first key of yours with a model that sees before that).

A choice you made on the row always wins, and the row says what *Automatic* gives right now. When a hands model of your own fails, nothing switches by itself; the card offers *Use nanoMuse Cloud this time* for that one turn ([own-key.md](own-key.md#which-model-does-what)).

The key goes into the vault like any other (`nanomuse vault set GUI_API_KEY`, or type it into the Phone card). The operator's model **must accept images**: a screenshot is the whole observation. The operator calls it at temperature 0 — grounding wants the model's first choice, not a sample.

Environment overrides: `NANOMUSE_GUI_ENABLED`, `NANOMUSE_GUI_PROVIDER`, `NANOMUSE_GUI_MODEL`, `NANOMUSE_GUI_BASE_URL`, `NANOMUSE_GUI_API_KEY`.

Other settings: `max_steps` (default 0 = no cap; set a number to bound a single `phone_task`), `device_timeout_s` (default 20, how long to wait for the phone to answer one request), `sensitive_words` (the list below).

## Connecting a phone

The agent does not have to run on the phone. A *device* connects to the nanoMuse server over the same WebSocket the app uses, announces itself and then answers requests for the screen and for actions. Two devices exist:

- **MobileGym** — the simulated phone at [mobilegym.dev](https://mobilegym.dev/), with Chinese apps (微信, 支付宝, 铁路12306, 地图, 小红书 …) as React apps in the browser. The nanoMuse module for it (`demo/mobilegym/`) has the switch *Let nanoMuse operate this phone* on its setup page. This is the showcase environment: nothing real is touched.
- **Android** — the nanoMuse app, through its own accessibility service: `takeScreenshot()` for the picture, `dispatchGesture()` for the finger, the accessibility tree for the element list, `performGlobalAction` for Back / Home / Recents, and the app's own list of launchable apps for `open_app`. Same protocol, real apps. It needs **Android 11 or newer** (that is where an accessibility service may take screenshots) and the service switched on:

  1. *Connections → Phone → This phone → Open Accessibility settings*, find **nanoMuse** under *Downloaded apps* and turn it on. Android explains what the service can do — see the screen, perform gestures — and asks you to confirm.
  2. On Android 13 and newer an app installed from a download (not a store) gets the switch greyed out with *Restricted setting*. Open the app's page in Settings (*App settings* on the same card), tap ⋮ → **Allow restricted settings**, then go back to step 1.
  3. Android turns accessibility services off on its own now and then — after an update, after an aggressive battery clean-up, on some phones after a reboot. The Phone card shows *Ready* / *Not yet* live; if the phone stops answering, look there first. The app announces the change to the server the moment the service comes or goes, so *Connections → Phone* is never stale.

  The service does nothing on its own: it takes a screen only when a `phone_*` tool asks for one, and every task shows a capsule at the top of the screen — the red panda, the step in progress and a **Stop** button (see below).

*Connections → Phone* shows which device is connected and how many apps it lists. `GET /api/phone` returns the same plus the last screen read.

## The tools

| Tool | Risk | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `phone_screen` | SAFE, reads private data | The current screen: a screenshot for the model to look at, with a caption — `铁路12306 (railway12306) · /station-select · 360×800 · keyboard hidden` |
| `phone_act` | MODERATE, or SENSITIVE (see below) | One action by position: `tap`, `long_press`, `double_tap` at `x`/`y` with a `label`; `swipe` to `x2`/`y2` or by `direction`; `type`, `enter`, `back`, `home`, `recents`, `open_app`, `wait`. Returns the screen after the action |
| `phone_task` | as its steps | Hands a goal to the *phone operator*: a loop with its own model that looks, acts and looks again until the goal is met, it needs you, or it gives up. Each of its steps is a `phone_act` and goes through Sentinel like any other |

**The screen is the last rung.** Search, a web page, mail, the calendar, files, a connector — when one of those gives the answer instantly and precisely, the agent uses it; the phone is for what only the user's own apps and accounts can do: 12306's real seats and prices, a 微信 chat, an order in 美团, a payment that needs their account. The phone is slower than a tool and every step is a model call, so the agent does not open 12306 to learn how far 北京 is from 上海 (see [The ladder](#the-ladder)).

The main agent uses `phone_task` for anything that takes more than a step or two ("open 12306, find the earliest train tomorrow from 北京 to 上海, report the first three"), and `phone_screen` / `phone_act` when it wants to look or do one thing itself. Both patterns are fine; the operator keeps the main model's context small.

## The operator

`phone_task(goal, app?, max_steps?)` runs an inner loop, ported from the `mobile_use` operator in [MemGUI-Bench](https://github.com/lgy0404/MemGUI-Bench) (MIT):

1. **Look.** Take the screen. The operator's model gets one picture — the current screen — plus the goal and the list of what it has done so far, each earlier step as one sentence (`Step 3: 点击「查询车站」按钮。; Result: …`). When the device sent an element list, up to 60 of its lines follow, fields first, each with its words, kind, flags and centre on the same 999 grid the model answers in (`- "密码" · EditText [editable, password] @ 500,375`): a second input for reading small text and aiming, never the first.
2. **Decide.** The model answers in a fixed shape: a `Thought:` line, an `Action:` sentence in the user's language, and one `<tool_call>` calling `mobile_use` — `click`, `long_press`, `swipe`, `type`, `open`, `system_button` (Back, Home, Menu, Enter), `wait`, `answer`, `ask_user` or `terminate`. Coordinates come back on a 999×999 grid and are scaled to the phone's pixels. A reply in the wrong shape is sent back once with a reminder, three times at most.
3. **Act.** The step becomes a `phone_act`, with the Action sentence as its `label` — that sentence is what Sentinel reads, what the approval card shows, and what the trace keeps. Then back to 1.

It stops with `done` and the model's `answer` (the text it read off the screen goes there), with `ask` when the model calls `ask_user` or Sentinel wants a decision (the main agent asks you and continues with your answer), with `blocked` after two refusals, with `stopped` when you press **Stop** on the phone, with `failed` on `terminate(failure)`, after `max_steps`, or when the phone stops answering. The same action three times in a row gets a note in the history so the model changes tack.

On a device with a capsule the operator also tells the phone when a task **begins** (the capsule appears with the goal), when it **ends** (the capsule goes), and when it **needs you** — an `ask` or a `blocked` becomes a card on the phone with the question and an *Open* button into the chat, because you are looking at 微信 at that moment, not at nanoMuse.

The operator's own rules, in its prompt: never type passwords, PINs, card numbers or one-time codes — `ask_user` first; never confirm a payment or a transfer it was not explicitly told to make; do only what the query asks, and when the query is "look this up", read and `answer` without pressing further.

## What Sentinel does with it

Everything read from the screen is private data: the session is *tainted* after the first `phone_screen`, so later steps that send data elsewhere are held to the stricter rules (see [sentinel.md](sentinel.md)).

A `phone_act` is MODERATE — allowed on its own in the default mode — except when it looks like it commits to something, in which case it is SENSITIVE with a warning, and a warning always means **ask, once**:

- a `tap`, `long_press`, `double_tap` or `enter` whose `label` contains one of `sensitive_words` — 确认支付, 立即付款, 转账, 提交订单, 立即购买, 发送, 删除, 注销, pay now, place order, send, delete … (an app's name is exempt: tapping the 支付宝 icon is not a payment step)
- `type` with `submit` — typing and submitting in one step, which the operator never does: it types, then taps the send button on the next step, so that step can be checked with the text in the field

A pointed action **must** carry a `label` — the words under the finger, as the screen shows them; the operator supplies its Action sentence. A tap without one still runs but carries a warning ("nothing says what is under the finger"), and a point outside the screen is refused before it reaches the phone.

The default word list is Chinese and English; edit `[gui] sensitive_words` for other apps or languages. Approvals granted here are *once* only: sending one message never turns into sending the next without asking.

On the computer there is one more ask, per application: the first `computer_act` in an app in a conversation asks *Let <Muse> use <App>?* with once / this conversation / always, kept as a `computer_app:<id>` grant (Settings → Permissions). The per-action rules above still apply inside the app. On macOS the hands can work in that app's window alone — [every-device.md](every-device.md#window-mode-macos).

### Handing the screen over

Passwords, one-time codes, CAPTCHAs and payment confirmations are the person's to type. The operator's `hand_over` action (and `computer_act` / `phone_act` / `browser` → `hand_over`, with a `reason`) puts a *Your turn — <reason> — Done* card in the chat (on the desktop, on the run's trajectory card) and on the capsule, and waits up to ten minutes. While the hold is on, every action of that tool on that thread waits; the person does their part and presses **Done**; the operator takes a fresh screenshot and is told *the user took over for a while; look again*. A password field in focus turns a `type` into a hand-over on its own. The person can also take over first: *Take over* on the Hands or browser card, or `POST /api/holds {"thread","tool","reason"}`; `POST /api/holds/{id}/done` ends it, and `GET /api/state` lists the open holds.

Since the observation is a picture, Sentinel judges by the *label* — the model's own words for what it is about to press — not by text it found in a tree. That is honest about what the operator knows, and it is why the label is required, why payment steps are also covered by the operator's own rule to stop and ask, and why grants are once-only.

## Traces

Every `phone_task` writes a JSONL trace under `<data_dir>/phone-traces/pt-<timestamp>-<id>.jsonl`: a `task` record (goal, app, context), one `step` record per iteration (the screen's app and route, the screenshot's path, the model's thought and Action sentence, the tool call, the device action actually sent, latency, any error) and an `end` record (status, message, steps, seconds). The last 200 traces and the last 400 screenshots are kept.

```
nanomuse phone traces                    # newest first: id, when, status, steps, goal
nanomuse phone trace pt-20260923-230710-5be7
nanomuse phone trace pt-20260923-230710-5be7 -o trace.html
```

The HTML page is self-contained — every screenshot inlined, the tap drawn as a ring and the swipe as a line on the very screen the model saw — so a run can be sent around or attached to an issue as one file.

## The device protocol

For anyone writing another executor. Messages ride on the app's WebSocket (`/ws`, the token in the first frame).

The device announces itself once:

```json
{"kind": "device", "name": "MobileGym", "platform": "mobilegym", "gui": true, "capsule": true,
 "apps": [{"id": "wechat", "name": "微信"}, {"id": "railway12306", "name": "铁路12306"}],
 "screen": {"width": 720, "height": 1600}}
```

and gets `{"kind": "device_ack", "phone": {…}}` back. A device may announce again on the same connection when something changed (the Android app does when its accessibility service is switched on or off; `gui` flips); the server keeps the connection's time of arrival and updates the rest. `"capsule": true` says the device shows a step capsule with a Stop button and wants the `task` requests below. The server then asks, one request at a time:

```json
{"kind": "device_request", "id": "r1", "op": "screen", "params": {}}
{"kind": "device_request", "id": "r2", "op": "act", "params": {"action": "tap", "x": 68.5, "y": 447.6, "label": "点击热门车站中的「北京」。"}}
```

and the device answers `{"kind": "device_result", "id": "r1", "ok": true, "result": …}` or `{"kind": "device_result", "id": "r1", "ok": false, "error": "…"}`.

A `screen` result is a picture and a few facts about it:

```json
{"app": "railway12306", "app_name": "铁路12306", "route": "/station-select",
 "width": 360, "height": 800, "keyboard": false,
 "screenshot": "<base64 PNG or JPEG>", "note": "optional"}
```

`screenshot` is the whole screen, `width` × `height` pixels — the same space the device takes its taps in, so a point in the picture is a point on the screen with no conversion; when a device sends no size at all the server reads it off the picture. (`image` is accepted as an older name for the same field.) The model reads the picture, and coordinates are pixels in it, top-left origin. `app`, `app_name`, `route` and `keyboard` are optional but make the captions, Sentinel's summaries and the traces better.

A device that has an accessibility tree — or a DOM, as the MobileGym module does — may add `nodes` — the elements that say or do something, flattened, at most 120, in the picture's pixel space:

```json
{"nodes": [
  {"id": "0.3.1", "class": "Button", "text": "查询车票", "cx": 180, "cy": 612, "box": [24, 588, 336, 636], "clickable": true},
  {"id": "0.2.0", "class": "EditText", "hint": "密码", "cx": 180, "cy": 400, "editable": true, "password": true}
]}
```

`id` is a stable index path into the tree, `text` / `desc` / `hint` the element's words, `res` its resource id; flags are `clickable`, `long_clickable`, `editable`, `password`, `checked`, `scrollable`, `focused`, `selected`, `disabled`. The server keeps the first 120, shows the operator the 60 most useful (fields first), and never requires the list — a WebView, a Flutter app, a game or a `FLAG_SECURE` screen has none, and the loop is the same without it. The Android app downscales the screenshot to 720 px wide before sending and scales the coordinates it receives back up, so the space the model sees is the space it taps in.

An `act` result is `{"note": "…", "screen": {…}}` — the screen as it looks once the action has settled, so a step costs one round trip.

Actions a device must handle:

| action | params |
|---|---|
| `tap`, `double_tap` | `x`, `y` |
| `long_press` | `x`, `y`, `seconds` (≤ 5) |
| `swipe` | `x`, `y`, `x2`, `y2` — or `direction` up/down/left/right with `distance` as a fraction of the screen and an optional start point |
| `type` | `text`, `clear` (empty the field first), `submit` (press enter afterwards); `x`, `y` of the field when known |
| `enter`, `back`, `home`, `recents` | — |
| `open_app` | `app` — an id or a name from the announce list |
| `wait` | `seconds` (≤ 10) |

Every pointed action also carries `label`: the executor should show it (see below) and may log it; it needs nothing else from it.

A device that announced `"capsule": true` also gets `task` requests — `{"op": "task", "params": {"event": "begin", "text": "<goal>"}}`, `"end"`, and `"notice"` with the question the agent has for the user — and answers them with an empty `ok`; they are best effort, and a device that does not answer in 3 s is not waited for. The `end` (or `notice`) is sent however the task finished — done, Stop, a device that went away, a model that failed, the chat run cancelled — but a socket that drops at that very moment never hears it. So the server also keeps the task under way in the phone's state — `"phone": {…, "task": {"goal": "…", "since": <unix seconds>}}` in every socket's `hello`, `null` when none — and a device should set its capsule from that when it (re)connects: a task still on gets its capsule back, a task that ended meanwhile takes it down. A capsule should also come down by itself when its socket is closed for good, or when a task that is supposedly on has asked nothing of the device for a long while (the MobileGym module uses three minutes).

**Stop.** When the user presses Stop on the device, the device fails the request in flight (and every one after it until the next `task begin`) with an error that contains the marker `nanomuse:stop`. The server turns that into a `stopped` outcome: the operator ends its loop, `phone_act` reports it in plain words, and the main agent is told not to go on operating the phone but to ask what to do next. A device without a capsule never needs to send the marker.

The MobileGym executor (`demo/mobilegym/apps/nanoMuse/gui.ts`) is a readable example: it renders the simulator's DOM to a PNG in the page (`modern-screenshot`, with the phone's CSS transform neutralised and the stage left out) at twice the phone's size — 720×1600, so the model reads small text, taps scaled back to the phone — walks the DOM for the `nodes` (what is interactive or says something, visible, not covered; the kind guessed from the tag and role), reads the app and route off the simulator's OS object, and drives MobileGym's own input API for the actions so a tap lands the way a finger would. It refuses to `type` into a password or code field the way the Android executor does: the capsule asks the person to fill it in and tap *Continue*.

## Showing the finger

An executor that moves in silence is unnerving to watch and impossible to follow. Devices should draw what Muse does, in the phone's own coordinate space, on a layer that is **excluded from the screenshot** (the model must not see the marks). The MobileGym module is the reference; the Android app follows the same spec with two accessibility overlay windows — an untouchable full-screen layer for the marks, and the capsule — both hidden for the instant a screenshot is taken.

| what | how it shows | timing |
|---|---|---|
| `tap`, `double_tap` | a ring that expands from the point and fades | 520 ms |
| `long_press` | a ring that holds, then fades | `seconds`, then 300 ms fade |
| `swipe` | a line drawn from start to end with a ring at the end | the swipe's own duration (320 ms), then fade |
| `type` | characters appear one by one | 40 ms per character |
| every action | a caption at the bottom: `Muse · <label>` (or `输入 “…”`, `打开 <app>`, `滑动 up`) | 2.6 s, replaced by the next |

After an action the executor waits for the UI to settle (650 ms on MobileGym; on Android until the accessibility events go quiet for 450 ms, 3 s at most) before it takes the screen it returns. The wait is part of the action, so a `screen` read never lands mid-transition.

### The capsule

On a device with a capsule — the Android app, and the MobileGym module, which draws the same pill in the simulated phone — a task is never silent: a pill at the top of the screen shows the red panda, the step in progress (*Muse · 点击「查询车票」*) and a **Stop** button, over whatever app is being operated. It appears on `task begin`, follows every step, and goes on `task end` — a tick for a moment, then the phone comes back to nanoMuse, where the agent's report is (the Android app brings itself to the front; the MobileGym module resumes the nanoMuse app); it is not part of the screenshot. Stop is the user's brake — no long press, no menu: one tap, the action in flight fails with `nanomuse:stop`, the pill says *Stopped* and hides itself, the phone comes back to nanoMuse, and the agent asks what to do next instead of carrying on. When the agent needs the user (`ask`, `blocked`) the pill grows into a card with the question and an *Open* button that brings nanoMuse to the front; it stays a minute, then folds away.

### The same on the desktop

The desktop app draws the hands in the phone's vocabulary, scaled for a pointer ([desktop-muse.md](desktop-muse.md#computer-use)): the glow breathing along the edges of the display (blue working, amber waiting), the marker — ring, turning cyan arc, dot, the action's name in a pill — at the point the operator acted on, a dashed path with an arrowhead for a drag, and a capsule at the top of the screen with the face, *Step N*, the step's words, *I'll take it* and *Stop*, shown while the nanoMuse window is not in front. Nothing there flows or sweeps; every light breathes at 2.4 s in, 2.4 s out, and is steady under *reduce motion*.

**The trajectory.** Where the phone shows the finger as it moves, the desktop also keeps the run to look back at: the chat shows, under the run's last hands call, each step's screenshot with the action drawn on it (click marker, drag arrow, scroll chevron, the typed text or key chord in the label pill) and the agent's words from just before the step, with previous/next, the arrow keys, *Open large* and *Copy this step*. It is built from what the hands already return — `computer_screen` / `computer_act` / `device_screen` give the picture and its first line gives the title and size; the `computer_act` arguments give the action, including `x2`/`y2` (or `box2`) for a drag and `dy` for a scroll — so nothing was added to the tools, the MCP results or the hub frames for it. The host keeps **40 steps per run, 4 runs, 64 MB of pictures** in memory and serves them to the window over `GET /nanomuse/cloud/trajectory?session=<id>` and `GET /nanomuse/cloud/stage/frame?seq=N`; the shapes and the caps are in [desktop-muse.md](desktop-muse.md#computer-use).

## Hands on the computer: the picture is the unit

The computer's hands (`computer_screen` / `computer_act`, [every-device.md](every-device.md#hands-on-this-computer)) follow the same rule as the phone's, with one more step, because a computer's picture and its pointer rarely share a size: a 4K display is 3840×2160 to X11 and to the mouse, 1920×1080 "logical" to Electron, and the model is shown a picture of 1596×896. Until 0.1.36 those spaces were mixed — the model was told the screen's size, shown a smaller picture and its numbers were clicked raw — which is why clicks on Linux landed beside their targets.

Now the **picture is the unit**. `computer_screen` says the picture's size on its first line (`<window in front> · 1596×896 · …`) and closes with *Coordinates: pixels of this 1596×896 picture, (0,0) top-left.*; `computer_act` takes `x`, `y` — or a `box` `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, whose centre is used — in that picture, and `drag` takes `x2`, `y2` / `box2` the same way. The runtime keeps the hands' own space (the operator's screen pixels) apart from the picture and converts once, just before acting and again for the trajectory and the glow (`nanomuse/computer/coords.py`, `Mapping`). The picture is the screen capped at `[hands] max_image_width`, then snapped to the 28-pixel grid Qwen3-VL resizes to (UI-TARS's `smart_resize`), so the model's own resize is the identity and a pixel it names is a pixel it saw. `[hands] coords = "norm1000"` makes `x`, `y` a 0–1000 grid over the picture instead, for a hands model trained that way.

Where the hands' space comes from, by backend:

| backend | the hands' space | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `desktop` (the desktop app) | the display's logical size × its scale factor; the scale factor is 1 on macOS (points) | the app's own operator — `@computer-use/nut-js`, a port of UI-TARS-desktop's — over loopback HTTP; `auto` takes it whenever the app set `NANOMUSE_OPERATOR_URL` |
| `pyautogui` | `pyautogui.size()` | points on macOS, physical pixels elsewhere; not used on a Mac under the desktop app |
| `xdotool` | `xdotool getdisplaygeometry` | X11 root pixels |

On macOS under the desktop app there is **one path**: the operator takes every screenshot and every move, or the tool fails with the operator's reason — without Screen Recording that is *macOS: switch on nanoMuse Desktop under System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording, then quit and reopen the app.* (the operator detects the refusal and the all-black capture and answers `403`). The runtime never falls back to `mss` / `screencapture` or `pyautogui` there: the permission belongs to the app bundle, a fallback would ask TCC a second time for a process that is not in the pane, and a black picture would reach the model as if it were the screen. Linux and Windows keep the Python fallbacks, and so does a runtime started without the app ([desktop.md](desktop.md#macos-permissions)).

Since 0.1.38 the operator on a Mac hands the capture and the input to **nanoMuse Computer Use**, a small Swift app inside the desktop bundle that holds the two grants itself (ScreenCaptureKit for the picture on macOS 14 and later — `SCScreenshotManager` on the main display, `CGDisplayCreateImage` on 12 and 13 — and `CGEvent` for the mouse and the keyboard, with the characters of any script typed directly). macOS attributes a permission to the process LaunchServices started, so a helper launched through `open` has its own row in the Screen Recording and Accessibility panes — switch on *nanoMuse Computer Use*, not the app — and a Screen Recording grant takes effect after the app restarts that one process, which it does by itself. The operator's contract above does not change: same routes, same coordinates (points), same `403` when the grant is missing, only the sentence now names the helper. When the helper's picture fails — ScreenCaptureKit refused, no image, the helper died or never started — the operator does **not** take a `desktopCapturer` frame in its place: `/screenshot` fails with the helper's own words (*no screenshot: nanoMuse Computer Use could not take the picture — ScreenCaptureKit userDeclined (-3801): …*, or *… did not start (…)*), the log says `helper screenshot failed (…) — not falling back to desktopCapturer`, and `computer_screen` carries the sentence to the chat. `desktopCapturer` and nut.js remain the path only for a build without the helper bundle ([desktop.md](desktop.md#macos-permissions)).

**Window mode on macOS** ([every-device.md](every-device.md#window-mode-macos)) goes through the same helper: the runtime asks the operator for the windows on screen (`GET /windows` — id, process, application, bundle id, title, frame in points) and for one window's own pixels (`POST /window {id}` — `SCContentFilter(desktopIndependentWindow:)`, no shadow, no cursor, with the frame alongside so a pixel of the picture maps to a point on the screen). The runtime never captures a window itself on a Mac under the app; the mouse and keyboard events of window mode are still posted from the runtime to the window's process (`CGEventPostToPid`), which is why the *nanoMuse* row in the Accessibility pane is needed next to the helper's. A refusal (the helper's Screen Recording row off, `403`) or a window that is gone (`404`) comes back in the operator's words and is retried on the next look; a helper that is not there at all parks the hands on the whole screen for that target with the reason in the observation. Without the helper bundle the runtime keeps its own `CGWindowListCreateImage` path and says so in its log (`window mode: the runtime captures windows itself …`).

On Linux the operator works under **X11** (Xorg) only. The hands' space is the X root in pixels — on a HiDPI desktop that is the logical size × the scale factor, 3840×2160 for a 1920×1080 scale-2 display — and `/info` says so; the picture is that root, scaled for the model as above. Under **Wayland** there is no global screen or cursor for a program to drive, so `/info` says the hands are off (*Wayland session: … Log in with Xorg …*), `/screenshot` refuses with the same sentence (`503`) rather than opening the portal's picker, and the runtime says it plainly on the first attempt — it does not fall through to `xdotool` or `pyautogui`, which would start under XWayland and move nothing you can see. The session type is read from `XDG_SESSION_TYPE`, or from a `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` without a `DISPLAY`. Two things 0.1.38 fixed in the X11 path: the glow (the frame the app draws around the screen while the hands work) is an X window too, and X11 forgets its click-through shape whenever it maps or is configured, so every click into it went nowhere — the operator now waits for the glow to be click-through before it moves the pointer; and libnut's `type` dropped Shift for the symbols of the US layout (`*` came out `8`, `!` as `1`, `_` as `-`), so those go in as Shift + the key under them, while text outside ASCII goes in through the clipboard and Ctrl+V as before.

The picture's size is bounded two ways: `[hands] max_image_width` (1600) and a pixel budget of 2 Mpx (`nanomuse/computer/coords.py`, `PICTURE_MAX_PIXELS`; the operator's `/screenshot` takes the same `max_pixels`, 0 for the screen as it is), both keeping the aspect ratio before the 28-pixel snap. A 4K screen comes down to half its side, 1080p is trimmed a little; a request with a few uncapped 4K pictures in it was what the relay refused with `413`.

What `computer_screen` reports to the client (`status()` / the event): `picture_size` and `screen_size` separately. The desktop app draws the prediction marker — a turning dashed ring, a dot at the exact point, the action's name beside it, a dashed line for a drag — from the operator's own fractions of the display, so what you see is where it clicked, not where the client thought it would.

## Limits

- One phone at a time: the most recently connected device with `gui: true` is the one the agent operates.
- The operator sees exactly what the device draws. Text it cannot read in the picture it cannot act on: a low-resolution screenshot is the first thing to check when it taps beside a target. The picture and the tap space are the same `width` × `height`, so a sharper picture means a device that announces — and taps in — a larger one.
- Apps rendered in an iframe inside MobileGym (nanoMuse itself, for one) are blank in an in-page screenshot; the operator is told the screen was dark rather than shown something wrong.
- Sentinel judges by the operator's words for what it presses. A screen that hides "pay" behind an icon with no words will not trip the list — which is why payment steps are also covered by the operator's own rule to stop and ask before paying, and why a payment is approved once at a time — the Android app lets you remember one for a single app or site only after confirming with the screen lock, and lists it first under Settings → Permissions. On Android the approval also reads what the accessibility tree says is under the finger, next to the label the operator reported, and the stricter of the two decides.
- On Android: the executor needs Android 11+; a `FLAG_SECURE` screen (banking apps, a payment sheet, a password manager) comes back black and the operator is told so; the Android executor refuses to `type` into a password field at all, whatever the label says; and Android may quietly refuse an `open_app` from the background — the executor then says so and asks the user to press Home and the icon (the *display over other apps* permission helps before Android 14). Text goes in through `ACTION_SET_TEXT` where the field allows it, otherwise through the clipboard and a paste.
