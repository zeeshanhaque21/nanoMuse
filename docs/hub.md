# The hub: every device is a Muse

Sign in to the same nanoMuse Cloud account on a phone, a computer and a browser,
and they see each other. Each device runs its own Muse with its own hands — the
phone's apps and sandbox, the computer's shell and screen — and any of them can
ask any other for something, from any network. The web console has no hands of
its own; it is a front door to the rest.

```
phone ──┐                         ┌── computer (nanoMuse Desktop)
        ├──▶  nanoMuse Cloud  ◀───┤
web  ───┘        /v1/hub          └── another phone / computer
```

Every device opens one outbound WebSocket to the relay and keeps it. Nothing
listens on the device, nothing needs a port forwarded or a shared Wi-Fi; the
relay only routes frames between devices of one account and never looks inside
a task. This is the way to add a computer: install nanoMuse Desktop on it and
sign in with the same account — nothing to download by hand, no code to type.
It is the only way in: the stand-alone host script that paired over the local
network (0.1.13–0.1.23) is gone, so a computer that is missing from the phone's
list has, nearly always, signed in with another account — *Settings → Computers*
on the phone shows which account the phone uses.

## What you can say

On the phone, in any chat:

- "在我 Mac 上列一下下载文件夹" — `nanomuse-pc ls ~/Downloads --on mac`
- "让电脑把项目编译一遍，把日志发给我" — `nanomuse-pc task "…" --on desk`
- "电脑截个图给我看" — `nanomuse-pc screen --on desk`

On the computer, in the terminal (`nanomuse-desktop`):

- "on my phone, take a screenshot" — `device_screen`
- "tell the phone's Muse to read me the last notification" — `delegate`
- "send the phone a notification: dinner's ready" — `device_notify`

In the web console (`/app`): pick a device, type. The task runs on that
device's Muse; approvals show as cards in the page.

Two kinds of request travel over the hub:

- **Actions** — `info`, `shell`, `files`, `file.get`, `file.put`, `open`,
  `screen`, `notify`. Raw and immediate. A `shell` command is judged *on the
  caller* before it is sent, with the same ladder as a local command (the
  phone's ShellGuard, the desktop's `guard.py`): reads and builds go quietly,
  deleting / sending / paying / system commands wait for the approval card on
  the device that asked.
- **Tasks** — `task {text}`: a whole job in words for the target device's own
  Muse, in a conversation of its own. It may take minutes. When that Muse hits
  something that needs approval, it does not decide alone: the question travels
  back as an `event {stage:"approval"}` and the asking device shows its usual
  card (RiskGate on the phone, the terminal prompt on the desktop, a card in the
  web console). The answer goes back as `approve {approval_id, allow}`.

  While a task runs the target sends `event` frames whose `body.stage` tells
  the caller what to draw, so the run reads the same in the caller's chat as in
  the target's own: `tool {id, name, summary}` when a tool starts and
  `tool_result {id, name, ok, summary}` when it ends (same `id`), `approval
  {approval_id, preview, risk, reason, device, timeout}` and, once decided on
  either side, `approval_result {approval_id, status}`, `text {text, interim}`
  for what the Muse says along the way, `image` and `file` for things it made,
  `error`. The `result` frame carries the final answer.

- **Coding agents** — `coding.agents`, `coding.sessions`, `coding.session`,
  `coding.send`, `coding.stop`, `coding.runs`: the Cursor / Codex / Claude Code
  sessions on a computer, read from disk and steered through the agents' own
  CLIs by the runtime there. `coding.send {agent, text, session_id?, workspace?,
  wait}` streams the run back as `event` frames (`started`, `text`, `tool`,
  `done`, `error`, each with the run id so the caller can `coding.stop`) and
  answers with the finished run. Only a runtime that has the module announces
  these actions. [coding-agents.md](coding-agents.md).

Each device decides what it lets others do. **Remote control** off (phone:
*Settings → nanoMuse Cloud → Devices*; desktop: `set remote_control off`) makes
the device answer `info` and nothing else — it still sees and drives the others.
With it on, a raw action that does something *to* the device (`shell`, `files`,
`file.get`, `file.put`, `open`, `screen`, `coding.send`, `coding.stop`) is first
agreed to by the person at that device: the usual approval card, *once* or
*always for that device* — the standing answer is a grant
(`remote_control:<device id>`) under Permissions. Nobody there, and the caller
hears `not_allowed` when the card expires. `info` and `notify` never ask; a
`task` runs under the device's own Sentinel, whose cards travel back to the
caller as before. A device may `approve` only cards of its own runs that were
sent to it — never the card asking whether it may run something.

## Frames

JSON text frames over `WS /v1/hub`, `Authorization: Bearer nm_…` (browsers put
the key in `hello` instead).

```
→ hello    {device:{id,name,kind,os,version,actions[]}}     kind: phone | computer | web
← welcome  {device_id, devices:[…], server:{version,frame_limit,time}}
← devices  {devices:[{id,name,kind,os,version,online,last_seen,controllable}]}

→ call     {id, to, action, args}
← call     {id, from:{id,name,kind}, action, args}          (delivered to the target)
→ event    {id, body}          ← event  {id, from, body}    progress, approvals, images
→ result   {id, ok, body | error, message}                  ← result (to the caller)
← error    {code, message, id?}   device_offline · not_controllable · self_call · unknown_call · too_large · bad_frame

→ devices  {}        → rename {name}        → forget {device_id}        → ping  ← pong
← profile  {rev, device}       the account's name, look or connectors changed (PUT /v1/me/profile); fetch it
```

Close codes: `4000` hello expected, `4001` bad key, `4002` bad device,
`4003` replaced by a newer connection of the same device id.

Device ids are per installation (`phone-…`, `pc-…`); names are for people and
can be changed on the device. A `web` device is never a target and is not
remembered. Bodies for `file.get`, `file.put` and `screen` carry the bytes in
base64 (`data`) with `mime`; the desktop refuses files over 8 MB, the relay
refuses frames over `HUB_FRAME_LIMIT`.

The agent's name and look are the account's, not a device's: `GET` / `PUT
/v1/me/profile` on the relay keep them (the dragon, an emoji on a colour, or a
face drawn in the avatar studio with its five small stills), last writer wins,
and a `profile` frame tells the other devices to fetch the new `rev`. The
runtime does this in `nanomuse/hub/profile.py`, the phone in
`io.github.nanomuse.cloud.ProfileSync`; the device that wrote it skips its own
echo.

The same profile carries **which device connected what** (0.1.34): a
`connectors` list with, per entry, the connector's id and label, its address
when it has one, how it signs in (`oauth`, `key` or `open`), the device's name
and id, whether it is enabled, and when. A device writes only the entries it
holds; the relay keeps the other devices' entries, caps the list at 64 and
refuses any entry that carries a token, secret, key, authorization or password
field — credentials never leave the device that signed in. The other devices
list those entries under the connectors catalogue as *Connected on \<device\>
— sign in here to use it on this device*, and the usual local sign-in is the
action. Nothing else is synchronised — keys, providers and settings stay where
they were entered.

## The code

How the devices' apps are shaped around these frames — the Devices page, a
side chat addressed to a device, approvals answered on either end, the
computer's own hands — is in [every-device.md](every-device.md).

- Relay: [`cloud/nanomuse_cloud/hub.py`](../cloud/nanomuse_cloud/hub.py) —
  per-account registry, routing, `GET /v1/devices`, `DELETE /v1/devices/{id}`;
  the console under [`cloud/nanomuse_cloud/console/`](../cloud/nanomuse_cloud/console/).
- Android: `io.github.nanomuse.hub` — `HubClient` (OkHttp, reconnect),
  `Hub` (state, prefs, `call`/`find`), `HubActions` (what the phone does for
  others, including `task` through the headless chat runner), `HubService`
  (foreground, `remoteMessaging`). `nanomuse-pc` (`io.github.nanomuse.reach`)
  reaches the hub devices from the phone's sandbox shell.
- Desktop binary: [`desktop/nanomuse_desktop/hub.py`](../desktop/nanomuse_desktop/hub.py),
  `app.py` (incoming calls, approvals), `agent.py` (the `device_*` and
  `delegate` tools).
- Runtime (the windowed desktop, `nanomuse serve`): [`nanomuse/cloud.py`](../nanomuse/cloud.py)
  (the account), [`nanomuse/hub/client.py`](../nanomuse/hub/client.py) (the
  socket, reconnect), [`nanomuse/hub/actions.py`](../nanomuse/hub/actions.py)
  (what this computer does for others), [`nanomuse/hub/service.py`](../nanomuse/hub/service.py)
  (incoming `task`s in a visible side chat, the `tool`/`tool_result`/`approval`/
  `approval_result` stages both ways, device threads), [`nanomuse/tools/devices.py`](../nanomuse/tools/devices.py)
  (`devices`, `device_*`, `delegate`); `/api/cloud/*` and `/api/hub/*` in
  [`nanomuse/server/api.py`](../nanomuse/server/api.py). Tests:
  `tests/test_hub.py` with a fake relay.
- Web app: `DevicesScreen`, the device chats and the relayed approval cards in
  [`web/src/`](../web/src/) — see [every-device.md](every-device.md).

## Trust

The relay authenticates every socket with the account key and routes only
within the account; it stores device names and last-seen times, not what was
asked. A device answers only devices of its own account, and only while its
*Remote control* switch is on — and, for anything that runs, reads or writes
there, after the person at that device agreed (once, or always for the asking
device). Commands are judged where they are typed, before they leave; a remote
Muse's approvals are answered by the person who asked, never by the other Muse. Signing out on a device revokes that device's key at
the relay and takes it off the hub; the *Devices* list on the phone and the
console shows every device that has ever signed in, so a device you no longer
recognise is visible, and *Forget* removes it once it is offline.
