# Feature parity across the clients

nanoMuse is one agent on every device: the phone (Android, iOS), the computer (nanoMuse Desktop —
the `dsh-nanomuse` harness bundle in the Electron shell) and the browser (nanoMuse Web, served by
the runtime). The rule since 0.1.32 is the **union**: whatever one client can do, every client
does, unless the platform itself forbids it (the computer does not build a mini-Linux the way the
phone does; iOS does not let an app drive another). This page is the ledger — what each client
has, what is platform-specific by design, and what is still open for a decision.

Legend: **✓** done · **◐** partial (what is missing is in the note) · **—** not on this client ·
**n/a** platform-specific, not meant to be.

## Open for a decision (the "next-next" list)

These are the gaps left open on purpose since 0.1.32 — either the platform makes them a
different design, or they are large enough that the call is the maintainer's. Numbers match the
notes above; a settled item keeps its number and says how it went.

1. **iOS · Data controls** — done in 0.1.33 (`NanoMuseDataControls.swift`).
2. **iOS · Steps.** The header line (and the face) are there since 0.1.33; the steps of the message
   still running stay visible even with the setting off, finished messages hide them. *Hide them
   too, now that the status line says what is going on?*
3. **iOS · Star after the first task** — done in 0.1.33, as a card pinned under the header (the
   message list is a UICollectionView; nothing can be placed under the last message). A cancelled
   turn counts as finished, the stream has no cancel signal. In 0.1.35 the card follows the
   relay's policy like everyone else (28): no ask in the first conversation, the 3rd task is the
   first moment.
4. **iOS · First run** — done in 0.1.34 (`NanoMuseFirstRun.swift`, the Android `needed / stage`
   logic). Shown to anyone without a Cloud account, so a person upgrading who only ever used their
   own key sees it once; *All settings* skips it.
5. **Android · OAuth connectors need a device test.** Discovery, dynamic client registration, PKCE
   and the token written into the entry's `Authorization` header compile and follow the desktop's
   flow line by line, but no connector was signed into on a device before 0.1.32 (no emulator on
   the build machine); the same goes for 0.1.33's client-id path (GitHub, Slack, …) and the
   browser hand-over. Key and open connectors are plain MCP entries and need nothing new. The
   token ends up in `servers.json` next to API keys, as the in-guest client reads it; refresh runs
   at app start and when the page opens, not in the background.
6. **iOS · Connectors** — done in 0.1.33 (`NanoMuseConnectors.swift`, the Android flow ported),
   with the same caveat as 5: compiled, not yet signed into on a device.
7. **Web · Connectors.** The runtime would have to run the OAuth flow itself and hold the tokens
   (the desktop does it in the harness host). The web app has MCP servers by hand. *Decision: run
   the flow in the runtime (`nanomuse mcp` already bridges connectors), or point the web app at a
   desktop on the account?*
8. **Desktop · Skills and coding agents pages.** The harness has its own skills; the coding agents
   live on the computer the desktop runs on, so a page would show the local CLIs. *Recommendation:
   coding agents page yes (the web app has one), skills no (duplicate).*
9. **iOS · Coding agents** — done in 0.1.34 (`NanoMuseCoding.swift`, the hub's `coding.*`).
10. **iOS · Hands.** iOS does not let an app drive another; App Intents / Shortcuts are the door.
    Not planned as "hands". Settled in 0.1.36: the Settings row is there (*Hands — Not on iPhone*)
    and opens a page that says why, and what a computer of the account can do; the iPhone's own
    Muse takes `task` calls from the other devices while the app is open (`@iPhone …`).
11. **iOS · The Muse shell** — done in 0.1.33 on the iPhone; in 0.1.34 Feed and Goals are real
    (`NanoMuseScheduler.swift`: foreground catch-up, `BGAppRefreshTask`, a local notification at
    the set time), the iPad runs the shell too, the shell and header switches are in the nanoMuse
    settings page, and the studio draws through the relay or your own Bailian key. Left: a
    routine runs in the background only when iOS gives the refresh task a slot — the copy says
    so (*at the set time the phone reminds you to open it*); the hub route (a computer of the
    account runs them) is still the sure one. The iPad's layout is the iPhone's, larger —
    settled in 0.1.35: no split layout of its own.
12. **Android and iOS · Emoji faces.** A face set to an emoji on the web or the desktop shows the
    dragon on the phones. Small.
13. **Theme colour swatches** — settled in 0.1.33: removed from the desktop; one rule everywhere,
    the accent follows the avatar.
14. **Android · Memory as a room.** It is a settings page on the phone, a room elsewhere. Design
    call.
15. **Browser viewer on the desktop.** The live stage shows the hands; a page viewer like the web
    app's is not there. Design call.
16. **Hand-over on the desktop and the web** — settled in 0.1.34, both: *holds* in the runtime
    (`nanomuse/agent/holds.py`; `hand_over` on `browser`, `computer_act`, `phone_act`; `POST
    /api/holds`, `/done`; `hold` events; the agent waits up to ten minutes and looks again). The
    desktop's stage shows *Your turn — Done* and *I'll take it*; the web's browser viewer can be
    driven (*Take over*, click, type, scroll, URL, *Done*). Left: iOS has no hands, so nothing
    to hand over there (10).
17. **Desktop · approvals outside the window** — settled in 0.1.34: the live stage carries
    *Allow once / Always in <app> / Deny*, and a small always-on-top capsule shows the same card
    when the main window is not in front. Left to check on a Mac: the capsule's `showInactive`
    must not steal focus from the app being driven — on the Mac task sheet
    (`docs/tasks/mac-check-0.1.36.md`, D).
18. **Connections shared across devices** — settled in 0.1.34: the profile's `connectors`
    (relay 0.17; merged per device, 64 at most, a key-like field name is a 400), four clients
    read and write it, the other devices' entries show as *Connected on <device> — sign in
    here*. The credential never leaves the device that minted it.
19. **Desktop · hands that do not fight the person** — settled for macOS in 0.1.34 the way the
    Codex app does it: *window mode* (`nanomuse/computer/mac_window.py`; `[hands] mode = auto`)
    captures one application's window and posts the events to its process, so the person keeps
    the mouse; each application asks once (*Let <Muse> use <App>?*). Elsewhere the screen is
    shared, with the UI-TARS-style glow and the overlays kept out of the shots. Left: Linux and
    Windows have no window mode (a virtual display or a second session would be the port — Linux
    first, cheapest); the macOS path is written against the Quartz APIs and must be tried on a
    Mac (Screen Recording fallback, AX-less clicks, Retina mapping, scroll direction). Settled in
    0.1.35: `auto` stays the default, with a fail-safe — when the Quartz layer itself fails (not
    "the window went away", which is retried every look) the hands fall back to the whole screen
    for the rest of that target and say so once; an explicit `window` mode keeps trying. Settled
    in 0.1.36 for the pointer itself: the desktop's hands are UI-TARS-desktop's operator moved
    into the Electron main process (`harness/desktop/src/operator.ts`, `@computer-use/nut-js`,
    loopback HTTP to the runtime's `desktop` backend), and the model's coordinates are pixels of
    the picture it saw, mapped once to the operator's screen (`nanomuse/computer/coords.py`) — the
    clicks that landed beside their targets on scaled displays are gone (≤1 px on a 4K display at
    scale 2). Left to try on a Mac and on Windows: the native addon in the packaged app, the
    coordinate space (points on a Mac), scroll units, ⌘ for `ctrl`, content protection — the Mac
    task sheet, F.
20. **Services without a public remote MCP server** — the chat apps are settled in 0.1.34 the
    way nanobot does it: 飞书, 钉钉, 企业微信 and Telegram are *channels* the agent answers in
    (`nanomuse/channels/`, the vendors' long-connection SDKs, no public address, pairing codes),
    which is what most people wanted from them. Still open as *connectors* (the agent reading or
    acting in the service): Zoom, LinkedIn, Zoho Invoice, WHOOP, 腾讯文档, 滴答清单, 网易邮箱, QQ
    邮箱, 微信读书 — each a bridge of its own over the vendor's REST API, one developer account
    per vendor. *Decision: which, if any, are worth a bridge?*
21. **Hands on Linux under Wayland.** The capture and the pointer need X11 or XWayland today; a
    Wayland session gives a black frame (now an error with the hint). Since 0.1.36 the operator
    says so itself (`/info` → `available: false`, *Wayland session … log in with Xorg*), and the
    Hands card shows the reason; UI-TARS-desktop has no Wayland path either. The portal route
    (`xdg-desktop-portal` ScreenCast + `libei`) would make it work natively, at the cost of a
    permission dialog per session. *Decision: worth it before the Linux desktop is promoted?*
22. **Chat apps on the phones.** The channels live in the runtime; the web app (and so the
    desktop) has the settings screen. Android and iOS would need an `/api/channels` client and
    the same card list (switch, fields, pairing codes, paired chats, Feishu QR) — the API and the
    strings are ready. *Decision: next version?* Also open: no vendor was connected end to end
    from the build machine (the SDK calls were checked offline against the real packages) — one
    test bot per vendor before announcing; Feishu sender names need `contact:user.base:readonly`;
    approvals from a chat are always *once*.
23. **Own-key presets and the chat default.** After a Bailian or OpenRouter key is saved, the
    provider's `/models` list decides what is offered; `deepseek-v4.1-flash` is not moved to the
    front automatically (only the Cloud group has `followPick`). *Recommendation: promote it when
    the list has it.*
24. **Relay billing of reasoning tokens.** Counted as completion tokens; when a provider reports
    them separately and the count exceeds the completion count they are added, otherwise taken
    as included. A provider that reports them separately *and* smaller would be under-counted.
    *Decision: keep the heuristic, or switch per provider?*
25. **Desktop · first run and first conversation** — settled in 0.1.35 after the phone: the host
    keeps `firstrun.json` and never skips the pages on a fresh install; the app speaks first
    (three scripted lines, no tokens), asks what to call you, and the model's `nanomuse-naming`
    fence becomes the naming card (`take_name` / `ask_user_question` are gone). Left, by design:
    the scripted lines are a client overlay, not stored messages; the address is a memory line
    rather than a `GLOBAL.md` edit; the gear on the first-run pages dismisses them for the
    session only.
26. **Desktop · macOS permissions** — re-audited in 0.1.35: TCC attributes the bundled runtime to
    the responsible process, so only *nanoMuse Desktop* has to be switched on (the words say so
    now; the runtime no longer appears as a second entry to hunt for). Left to try on a Mac: the
    *Try it* rows after a fresh grant, the restart dialog when Screen Recording flips on, the
    capsule's `showInactive` (17), window mode's AX-less clicks and Retina mapping (19), the
    face click after 0.1.36's change (no drag region under the face at all; the face below the
    title-bar band) — all on the Mac task sheet, `docs/tasks/mac-check-0.1.36.md`, written so that
    an agent on a Mac can run it end to end and send the fixes back.
27. **Web · motion clips.** The clips are per device (drawn where the face lives: the phone, the
    iPhone, the desktop). The web app shows the still face. *Decision: draw them in the runtime
    too, or leave the web still?*
28. **Star asks · what counts.** The policy is the relay's (`/v1/admin/nudges`, console → Star
    asks) and reaches every client within a day without an update. Two small differences left:
    Android asks once per phone when the allowance is spent (the other clients the same); the
    first feed day is not written when the person changes the face during the naming conversation
    (the first run never reaches *done*). Small.
29. **One conversation on every device** — settled in 0.1.36 (contract C7 in `docs/cloud.md`): the
    text of the chats lives on the relay (`/v1/sync/*`, relay 0.19), on by default when signed in,
    with the switch and the delete under Data controls on every client; one main conversation per
    account; what a device started on its own (routines, goals, the feed, work for another device)
    stays on it. One thread since 0.1.37 (contract C8): the main chat on every device is the union
    of what was said on all of them in time order, the other devices' turns as read-only bubbles
    (*From Pixel 8*) the model reads too; a side chat from elsewhere is a chat on the device at
    once; the person's message goes up when sent, the reply at the turn's end; the whole history
    is backfilled on sign-in. The desktop appends the other devices' turns to the dsh session log
    (`user/message`, source `nanomuse-sync`) and dresses them in the browser. Left: the dsh plugin
    has no delete, so an archived session is not a tombstone, a message deleted elsewhere is hidden
    rather than removed from the log; switching sync off on one device reaches the others at
    their next push or pull (a `409`), not at once; on iOS a pulled message that arrives late sits
    after the local ones (the OpenMinis store appends). `@<device name>` runs a turn on another
    device — computers whenever online, phones while the app is open; on iOS the mention goes to
    the hub directly (no `delegate` tool there) and the iPhone answers `task` calls itself.
30. **iOS · composer, bubbles, header** — settled in 0.1.36 after the phone: the one-row pill,
    flat grey bubbles for the person, a floating translucent header. Left: on iOS 16–18 the
    transcript starts below the header's edge rather than scrolling under it (the UIKit list
    needs the inset passed down; to be tried on a device — the risk of covering the first message
    was not worth taking blind).
31. **Desktop · the operator on a Mac and on Windows.** Ported from UI-TARS-desktop and proven on
    Linux X11; the native addon, the coordinate space (points on a Mac, physical pixels on
    Windows), scroll units, ⌘ for `ctrl`, content protection of the glow are on the Mac task
    sheet (`docs/tasks/mac-check-0.1.36.md`, F). Wayland stays item 21.

## Keeping this true

- The desktop's connectors catalogue is the source (`harness/dsh-nanomuse/src/connectors-catalogue.ts`);
  `node scripts/connectors-json.mjs` writes the Android asset and the iPhone's bundled copy,
  `--check` (in the harness workflow) fails when either is stale.
- Relay-facing code mirrors the same wire format on every client: `nanomuse/cloud.py` (runtime),
  `harness/dsh-nanomuse/src/relay.ts` (desktop), `io.github.nanomuse.cloud.NanoMuseCloud` (Android),
  `NanoMuse/NanoMuseCloud.swift` + `NanoMuseAccount.swift` (iOS). A new relay field lands in all four.
- The star asks follow one policy everywhere — the relay's `/v1/nudges` (contract C1 in
  `docs/cloud.md`), with the same defaults built into every client: a *task* is a turn the person
  started that got a reply, never the first conversation, a routine, a feed post or a goal
  check-in; once per moment, `cooldown_days` apart, `max_asks` per device, never again after
  *Star on GitHub* (`nm.star.*` / `nanomuse.star.*`). Clients: `nanomuse/nudges.py`,
  `harness/dsh-nanomuse/src/nudges.ts`, `web/src/nudges.ts`, `io.github.nanomuse.community.Nudges`,
  `NanoMuse/NanoMuseNudges.swift`.
- The release check reads the same sources in the same order on every client: this fork's GitHub
  `releases/latest` first, then a configured mirror index only when one is set; a day's cache; the
  row always shows the installed version too.
- Conversation sync speaks one wire format (contract C7 in `docs/cloud.md`) from four clients and
  one relay: `cloud/nanomuse_cloud/sync.py`, `nanomuse/sync/` (runtime and web), `harness/dsh-nanomuse/src/sync.ts`
  (desktop), `io.github.nanomuse.sync` (Android), `NanoMuse/NanoMuseSync.swift` (iOS). Every client
  applies a page's conversations before its messages and moves its cursor only on a pull; every
  client pushes the person's lines and the final answer only — never tool steps, tool results or the
  system prompt — and leaves routines, goals, the feed and work for another device at home.
- `ideas.en.json` / `ideas.zh.json` are one file four times (Android assets, iOS Resources,
  `harness/dsh-nanomuse/assets`, `web/src/ideas`); the harness and web tests fail when a copy drifts.
