# Trial runbook: one account, all your devices

What it takes to run the private trial end to end — relay, phone, computers,
web — from a clean VPS to "the phone tells the Mac to build the project".
Everything here is in the private `nanomuse-trial` repository (branch `trial`)
until it ships in the public one.

## 0. What you need

| | for |
|---|---|
| A small Linux VPS with Docker (1 vCPU / 1 GB is plenty) and a domain name pointed at it, e.g. `cloud.example.com` | the relay + hub + web console |
| An OpenAI-compatible model key — Alibaba Model Studio (百炼) by default; the same key serves pictures | what the Muses think with |
| A way to send codes: SMTP credentials (e-mail sign-in) and/or Aliyun SMS (mainland numbers) — or `CODE_SENDER=log` and read codes from the server log while it is only you | sign-in |
| Android phone: the arm64 debug APK from `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` (sideload) | the phone's Muse |
| Computers: the installer for each from the `desktop` workflow artifacts — *Actions → desktop → Run workflow* builds all four (Windows `-setup.exe`, macOS `.pkg` for Apple silicon and Intel, Linux `.deb`); a `desktop-v*` tag also publishes them as a release | the computers' Muses |
| iPhone (optional): TestFlight through the `ios-testflight` workflow — needs an Apple Developer account and App Store Connect API key in the repo secrets; run *iOS · build check* first, it needs neither | the iPhone on the hub (it answers `info`, `open`, `notify`; shell, files and tasks on the iPhone are still to come) |

## 1. The relay

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nano-muse/nanomuse-trial.git && cd nanomuse-trial/cloud
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill `.env`:

```
CLOUD_DOMAIN=cloud.example.com
PUBLIC_BASE=https://cloud.example.com
CLOUD_SECRET=<openssl rand -hex 32>        # back it up with data/: rotating it orphans accounts
CLOUD_ADMIN_TOKEN=<openssl rand -hex 32>
UPSTREAM_BASE=…/compatible-mode/v1          # your Model Studio endpoint
UPSTREAM_KEY=sk-…
DASHSCOPE_BASE=…/api/v1
SIGNUP_OPEN=0                               # members only while you try it; 1 opens sign-up
ALLOWED_IDENTIFIERS=139xxxxxxxx, you@example.com   # members: no daily cap
DAILY_CAP_CNY=25                            # yuan a day for everyone else once sign-up is open
CODE_SENDER=smtp                            # or aliyun / both / log
SMTP_HOST=… SMTP_PORT=465 SMTP_USER=… SMTP_PASSWORD=… SMTP_FROM=nanoMuse <no-reply@example.com>
HUB_ENABLED=true
```

```bash
docker compose up -d            # relay on :8787 behind Caddy, which fetches the certificate
docker compose logs -f relay    # codes appear here when CODE_SENDER=log
curl https://cloud.example.com/healthz
```

The web console is at `https://cloud.example.com/app/`, the operator's page at
`/app/admin/` (asks for `CLOUD_ADMIN_TOKEN`: who signed in, usage, devices,
grant / disable / delete). Data (SQLite) lives in `cloud/data/`; back it up
together with `CLOUD_SECRET`. Tokens have no ceiling by default; the daily
money cap (`DAILY_CAP_CNY`) is what limits an account, and members escape it.

Upstream's production relay is this same code on the box behind its showcase's
Caddy; **this fork runs no default relay** — deploy your own from `cloud/`;
[`cloud/deploy/nanomuse-hk/`](../cloud/deploy/nanomuse-hk/README.md) has the
compose file, the Caddy site, the backup timer and the deploy script.

## 2. The phone

Install the APK. On the first screen, *接入模型* → your number or address →
the code → done: the nanoMuse Cloud provider, a default model group, and the
hub connection are set up in one go. (A debug build shows the *中转服务器*
field; type your relay's address there. Release builds use the default relay.)

*Settings → nanoMuse Cloud* now has a **Devices** section: the two switches
(reachable · operable), the phone's name (rename it to something you will say
out loud — "pixel", "小米"), the other devices, and the console link. A quiet
notification shows while the phone is on the hub.

## 3. The computers

Install the package. Then, in a terminal:

```
nanomuse-desktop
```

Server → number or address → code. Name the computer (`nanomuse-desktop rename mac`).
`nanomuse-desktop run --open` chats in the terminal and opens the console;
`nanomuse-desktop serve` keeps it reachable without a chat (put it in a login
item / systemd user service / Task Scheduler if you want it always on).

## 4. Try it

On the phone: 「在 mac 上列一下下载文件夹」 「让 desk 把 ~/proj 编译一遍，把最后二十行日志发我」
「电脑截个图给我看」 「给电脑发个通知：该睡了」

On the computer: "on the phone, take a screenshot", "tell pixel's Muse to read
me the last notification", "send pixel a notification: build finished".

In the console: pick a device, type; approvals show as cards.

Anything that deletes, sends, pays or touches the system asks first — on the
device where you typed it. A remote Muse's approval question comes back to you
the same way.

## 5. Operating

```bash
# accounts (hints only, never identifiers) and allowance
curl -H "X-Admin-Token: $CLOUD_ADMIN_TOKEN" https://cloud.example.com/v1/admin/accounts
# top up
curl -H "X-Admin-Token: $CLOUD_ADMIN_TOKEN" -X POST https://cloud.example.com/v1/admin/grant \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"identifier":"139…","tokens":1000000}'
# who is on the hub (with a device's own key)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer nm_…" https://cloud.example.com/v1/devices
```

Letting someone else in: `SIGNUP_OPEN=1` and `docker compose up -d` again lets
anyone register with the daily cap; *设为成员* on the admin page, or a line in
`ALLOWED_IDENTIFIERS`, lifts the cap for one person.

## 6. Where it stands

Verified on the development machine: relay + hub, Linux desktop, Android
emulator and the web console on one account — phone→PC (`devices`, `run`,
`ls`, `notify`, `task`), PC→phone (`info`, `notify`, `task`, natural-language
notify + delegate), web→phone and web→PC (tasks, approval cards), rename and
forget (also from the console). The macOS and Windows packages come out of CI
(the `desktop` workflow, all four targets green) and were not run on real
machines here. The iOS side — sign-in and the hub client — is written without
a Mac; the `ios-check` workflow is the compile test, the `ios-testflight`
workflow the delivery. Shell and files on the phone use the Linux sandbox,
which exists on arm64 phones (the emulator build has none).
