/**

 * process (Electron) rather than by the Python runtime it starts. Why here: the app bundle is
 * what macOS grants Accessibility and Screen Recording to, Electron knows the display's real
 * geometry, and UI-TARS-desktop has run this very operator on many desks already. The
 * runtime reaches it over loopback (operator-server.ts) and keeps the brain — the agent loop,
 * the Sentinel, the tools.
 *
 * Coordinates: everything in and out of here is in the *operator's screen pixels* — the space
 * libnut moves the pointer in. On Linux (X11) that is the root window's pixels, on Windows
 * physical pixels (the process is DPI-aware), on macOS points — which is why the scale factor
 * is taken as 1 there, as UI-TARS does. The screenshot is the primary display at exactly that
 * size (or scaled to the size the runtime asks for), so a pixel of the picture is a pixel the
 * pointer can be sent to; the runtime does the picture ↔ screen arithmetic.
