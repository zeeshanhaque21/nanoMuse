/**
 * Routes the preset mounts on the harness's web server, admitted the way the
 * harness admits its own `/api`.
 *
 * `webServer.register` dispatches a request to its handler as it came in: the
 * Host/Origin fence (against DNS rebinding and a web page poking the loopback
 * port) and the browser session the launch token minted are applied by the
 * `connection` service, and only to the routes that ask. A route registered
 * raw answers any local process and any page open in any browser — for the
 * account's routes and the connectors' that is a sign-out, a connection to a
 * stranger's server or a spent allowance away. So every nanoMuse route goes
 * through here, and a request the harness would turn away from `/api` is
 * turned away from `/nanomuse/*` with the same status.
