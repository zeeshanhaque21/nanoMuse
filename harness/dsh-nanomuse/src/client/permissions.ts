/**
 * One reading of the system permissions the hands use, shared by the onboarding
 * slides, the Computer-use page, the Permissions summary and the Dictation page,
 * so that every place says the same thing at the same moment.
 *
 * The system's word is re-read on a timer, when the window gets focus and when
 * the page becomes visible again — the person flips a switch in System Settings
 * and comes back, and the row must already show the check. Where nothing is
 * gated (Linux, Windows) every permission reads `not-needed`, which the rows
 * show as granted, and no Allow button is offered.
 *
 * Two things the system does not tell and the hook remembers for the copy:
 * which permissions the person already asked for in this session (the button
 * then says "Open System Settings" — a second press cannot bring the dialog
 * back), and whether Screen Recording was granted while the app ran: macOS
 * applies that one only to freshly started processes, so the runtime that takes
 * the screenshots has to be started again (`needsRelaunch`).
