/**
 * nanoMuse Cloud for the harness: `ctx.nanomuseCloud`.
 *
 * One account, every device. A person signs in with a mainland phone number or
 * an e-mail and a six-digit code; the relay answers with this device's key.
 * The key goes to the harness credential store (`NANOMUSE_CLOUD_TOKEN`), and the
 * account's models are written into the profile's `llm-pi-ai` row as the
 * `nanomuse` provider — the same two writes the Models page makes for any
 * OpenAI-compatible gateway — so the harness's own adapter talks to the relay
 * and the models appear in the picker. Nothing of ours sits in the model path.
 *
 * Signed in, this computer is also a device of the account:
 *
 * - the **profile** (`profile.ts`): the agent's name and face come from the
 *   account and follow the phone's avatar studio;
 * - the **hub** (`hub.ts`): one socket to `/v1/hub`, so the phone lists this
 *   computer, this computer's Muse reaches the phone (`reach.ts`), a `notify`
 *   from another device shows here, and — with *remote control* on, as it is
 *   by default — the phone runs things here (`actions.ts`);
 * - the **hands tracker**: every Hands or Reach tool call in flight, so the
 *   browser half can draw the capsule the Android app draws while it works.
 *
 * The browser half (`client/`) drives all of this through a small loopback HTTP
 * API under `/nanomuse/cloud/*` — plain JSON plus one server-sent-events stream
 * (`/events`) carrying the live state — registered when the web server is
 * present; the headless and SDK profiles get the service without routes.
