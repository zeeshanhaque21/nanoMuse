/**
 * The first run and the first conversation, the way the phone does them (C4), as
 * pure shapes and decisions. No Cordis, no files: `rooms.ts` keeps the state in
 * `$DSH_HOME/nanomuse/firstrun.json`, serves it under `/nanomuse/rooms/firstrun/*`
 * and calls into here; the browser half imports the same module for the copy the
 * app speaks on its own behalf, so both halves agree on every word.
 *
 * The setup pages (Welcome → Password → Which model answers → Choose models →
 * Permissions → Meet <name>) end with Start, which binds the main chat as the
 * first conversation. There the app speaks first — three scripted lines, zero
 * tokens, never in the model's history — and asks what to call the person. From
 * then on the model does the talking and reports what happened in a small
 * `nanomuse-naming` block at the end of its reply; the phase moves on that block
 * and on nothing else. A reply without one means the person talked about
 * something else, the model helped and steered back, and the phase stays.
