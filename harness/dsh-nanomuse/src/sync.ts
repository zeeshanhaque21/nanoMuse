/**
 * Conversations synced between the account's devices (contracts C7 and C8), the
 * desktop's half. The relay keeps the text of every conversation under `/v1/sync/*`;
 * this computer pushes the person's words the moment they are sent and the model's
 * final text when the turn ends, and pulls what the other devices pushed — on start,
 * on the hub's `sync` frame and every minute.
 *
 * **One thread** (C8). A conversation written on another device is not a mirror
 * beside the chats here: it *is* a chat here. The account's one main conversation
 * lives in the main chat of this computer (its id adopted from the relay when the
 * relay has one), and a side conversation pulled from the relay gets a dsh session
 * at once, with its title, so it continues here like any other chat and its turns
 * go up under the same conversation id. The turns written elsewhere are *kept* by the
 * host in a store of its own (`$DSH_HOME/nanomuse/sync-remote.json`) — never written
 * into the session's log: a `user/message` appended there outside a turn makes the log
 * unreadable once a turn runs, and the chat does not render such a row anyway — and the
 * browser half (`client/RemoteBubbles.ts`) shows them as the other device's bubbles,
 * "From Pixel 8" under each, placed by their time among the local turns. The model
 * hears them as context for its next step (`agent.inject`, a note per pull: "Meanwhile,
 * in this same conversation on another device…"), model-facing, never the person's
 * words, so never pushed back; a row from this device coming back on a pull is known
 * by its device and never kept twice.
 *
 * On sign-in and when the switch goes on the pull comes first (the relay's history
 * reaches the sessions here), then the whole eligible history of this computer goes
 * up, oldest first, 200 messages a POST.
 *
 * **Main first** (C9). Only the main conversation syncs unless this device's "Also sync
 * side chats" is on (`state.sideChats`): off, side chats are neither pushed nor pulled
 * (`scope=main`), and a side row that still arrives makes no session. The first pull of an
 * account asks for the newest 300 messages (`tail=300`); the switch going on pulls the
 * account's side chats the same way, once. While a turn runs here on a synced conversation
 * the relay is told (`POST /v1/sync/working`, best-effort), and the other devices' `working`
 * frames put a quiet "kwai is working…" line under their last prompt here (`workingOf`).
 *
 * **Whose conversations** (C10). Every mapping entry carries the `owner` — the `account.id` of
 * the account the session was first pushed to or pulled from; a conversation written while
 * signed out and never synced has none. Signed in as B, the column shows B's and the
 * ownerless (`view().foreign` names the rest, hidden, not deleted), the push loop takes B's
 * and the ownerless — which become B's on their first push — and never A's; a different
 * `account.id` than the last one starts the pull over (cursor 0) and drops what was pulled
 * for A (the relay's rows, the kept turns, presence), keeping A's mapping so switching back
 * works. Signed out, everything local is shown and nothing moves.
 *
 * Never a key in a log, never a file: attachments travel as names and sizes.
