"""Holds: the person takes a browser, a screen or a phone over for a while, and the agent
waits (docs/browser.md, docs/gui.md).

A *hold* belongs to one chat (``thread``) and one kind of hands (``tool``: ``browser``,
``computer`` or ``phone``). It is opened by the person ("Take over" in the app — ``by:
user``) or by the agent when a page needs them ("hand_over" with a reason: a sign-in form,
a CAPTCHA, a payment — ``by: agent``), and closed by the person's **Done**. While a hold is
on, every action of that tool for that chat waits at :meth:`Holds.wait`; it does not fail.
When the hold goes off, the waiting tool takes a fresh observation and tells the model that
the person took over for a while, so it looks again instead of trusting what it last saw.

Every change is a ``hold`` event in the chat's timeline (``status: on | off``), so the chat,
the capsule on the phone, the stage on the desktop and the browser viewer in the web app
all show one card with the same Done button. The open ones ride in the hello state as
``holds``.
