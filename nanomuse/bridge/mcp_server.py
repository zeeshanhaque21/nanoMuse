"""The hands as an MCP server: ``nanomuse mcp``.

A host that is not our runtime — nanoMuse on DeepSeek Harness (docs/harness.md) — gets
this computer's screen and hands the way it gets any other capability: as an MCP server
on stdio. The two tools are the runtime's own ``computer_screen`` and ``computer_act``
(:mod:`nanomuse.tools.computer`), with their descriptions and schemas, so a model that
knows one host knows the other; ``computer_task`` stays home, because the host's model
runs the loop itself.

What the Sentinel does in the runtime, the bridge does at the model's level: a call the
runtime would ask the person about — Enter or a submit, a heavy shortcut, a click on words
from the sensitive list (password, pay, …) — is refused with the reason, unless the call
carries ``confirmed``. With ``NANOMUSE_MCP_CONFIRM`` in the server's environment (the
nanoMuse desktop sets it: one random secret per launch, shared with its plugin), only the
host can confirm: ``confirmed`` must be the ticket :func:`ticket` computes over the call's
arguments with that secret, which the plugin produces after the person said yes on the
permission card — a ``true`` the model wrote on its own is refused. Without the variable
(``nanomuse mcp`` added to some other host by hand) ``confirmed: true`` is taken at the
model's word, as before, and the host's own approval policy is the gate.

Compatible with mcp 1.x and 2.x, like the client in :mod:`nanomuse.tools.mcp_tools`.
