"""This computer as a device the operator can look at and act on — the same face
:class:`~nanomuse.phone.link.PhoneLink` shows for the phone, so the operator loop, the
tools and the GUI's cards are shared.

``screen()`` is a screenshot plus the window in front; ``act()`` is one action of the hands
(:mod:`nanomuse.computer.hands`), followed by a short settle and a fresh look. ``stop()`` is
the Stop button: the next action raises :class:`~nanomuse.phone.link.DeviceStopped`, which
ends the task the way the phone's Stop pill does. Every action and task boundary is also
handed to ``on_event`` — the GUI shows a *Hands* card with the current step and the desktop
stage draws a cursor where the click lands (``x``/``y`` in the hands' screen pixels,
``fx``/``fy`` as fractions of the screen).

Coordinates: the picture the model sees is the unit. ``Screen.width``/``height`` are the
picture's size, and every ``x``/``y`` the tools accept is a pixel of it. The hands move in
their own screen space (``screen_w``/``screen_h``: X11 root pixels, macOS points, Windows
physical pixels), and the one place the two meet is :class:`~nanomuse.computer.coords.Mapping`
— applied in ``_do`` before an action and in ``_where`` before the overlay hears of it.
When nanoMuse Desktop started this runtime, its operator (:mod:`nanomuse.computer.operator`)
takes the screenshot and does the moving; otherwise the Python backends do.

Two modes (``[hands] mode``). *Screen*: the whole screen through ``mss`` and the system
mouse. *Window* (macOS, :mod:`nanomuse.computer.mac_window`): one application's window —
the picture the model sees is that window (taken by the desktop app's helper when the app
is around, by the runtime's own Quartz call otherwise), events go to that process, the
person keeps the cursor. ``auto`` is window mode on macOS as soon as a target application is set
(``set_target``, the ``computer_target`` action or ``app`` on ``computer_act``), screen
everywhere else. A window that cannot be found or captured drops back to the screen with a
note in the observation, never an error that ends the task.
