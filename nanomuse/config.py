"""Configuration loading.

Search order for the TOML config file:

1. explicit path (``--config`` / :func:`load_settings(path)`)
2. ``$NANOMUSE_CONFIG``
3. ``./config/config.toml``
4. ``~/.nanomuse/config.toml``

String values may reference environment variables with ``${VAR}`` or
``${VAR:-default}`` so that secrets never have to live in the file itself.
A handful of ``NANOMUSE_*`` environment variables override the most common
settings (see :func:`_apply_env_overrides`). Whatever was changed from the app
(``<data_dir>/app-settings.json``: model, connectors, MCP servers) is layered on
top; secrets it refers to live in the vault as ``{{vault:NAME}}``.
