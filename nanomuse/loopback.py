"""Connecting to ourselves on Windows.

Windows has no ``socketpair()``, so Python emulates it: a listening socket on 127.0.0.1, a
connect to it, an ``accept``. asyncio needs one such pair for every event loop (its
"self-pipe"), before the loop runs a single step. On a machine where something intercepts
local connections — a proxy client with every connection routed through it (Proxifier, a
TUN mode), security software holding an unknown program's ports — that ``accept`` never
returns, the stdlib has no timeout on it, and ``nanomuse serve`` sits there forever,
listening on nothing. That was a Windows desktop that "would not open" without a word.

:func:`install` replaces ``socket.socketpair`` on Windows with one that waits a few seconds,
tries the IPv6 loopback when the IPv4 one is intercepted (a TUN mode often takes only IPv4),
and otherwise fails with an explanation. :func:`check` is the same test done once up front
so the server can say what is wrong and stop instead of hanging.
