"""Tidying long-term memory: merge what says the same thing, keep the newer fact, drop
what was never a fact about the user.

Memory grows one line at a time, in the middle of other work, so after a few weeks it
holds "prefers window seats" and "likes a window seat on flights", "lives in Shanghai"
next to "moved to Beijing in March", and "asked for the weather in Kyoto". A tidy-up
asks the model for a short list of changes, applies the ones that pass the checks
below, and logs each with the text it replaced so the user can undo it.

The model proposes; this module decides. It never invents a fact (a merged line may
only use words that were there), never drops a line the user wrote themselves, and
takes out at most a fifth of the store in one pass (four lines at least); when
more was proposed, the next pass follows at the next scheduler tick.

TIDY_PROMPT = """You maintain the long-term memory of a personal agent: short facts about one user, saved over time. Below is everything it holds. Propose the changes that make it smaller and truer without losing anything the user would want kept.

Rules:
- merge: two or more lines that say the same thing, or where one is a more detailed version of another → one line that keeps every detail (names, numbers, dates). When lines contradict because the fact changed (a move, a new job), keep the newer fact and mention the change if it matters ("Lives in Beijing, moved from Shanghai in 2026").
- drop: a line that is not a durable fact about the user: a one-off request, a finished errand, something about today's weather, a duplicate of something kept.
- Do not invent, embellish, or generalise. Do not merge lines about different people or topics. Do not touch anything that is fine as it is. When nothing needs doing, answer [].
- Keep the user's wording and language.
