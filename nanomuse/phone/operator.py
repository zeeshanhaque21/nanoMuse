"""The GUI operator: a step loop on the phone's screen with its own model.

The main agent hands over one concrete goal (``phone_task``). The operator looks at the
screen — a screenshot, nothing else — decides one action, does it through the Sentinel
(every tap is a ``phone_act`` call, assessed and, when it looks like paying or sending,
approved by the user), looks again, and so on, until it is done, must ask, or gives up. It
then reports back in words; the main agent goes on with the rest of the task.

The model is the one under ``[gui]`` — a model that takes images — or the main model when
none is set. It is spoken to in the ``mobile_use`` dialect of the Qwen-VL agents: a tool
schema whose coordinates live in a 999×999 space, and one ``Thought: / Action: /
<tool_call>`` reply per step. That format is what the open Qwen-VL models were trained on
for phone operation, so it is used as is rather than a JSON dialect of our own.

The same loop drives this computer's screen (docs/every-device.md): a :class:`Dialect`
swaps the function offered to the model — ``computer_use``, the Qwen-VL desktop dialect,
with mouse buttons and key combinations instead of taps and system buttons — and what its
steps become on the device (``computer_act`` through :class:`~nanomuse.computer.link.ComputerLink`).

original Qwen ``mobile_use`` tool restored and our device actions on the other end.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """# Tools

You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.

You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:
<tools>
{tool}
</tools>

For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:
<tool_call>
{{"name": <function-name>, "arguments": <args-json-object>}}
</tool_call>

# Response format

Response format for every step:
1) Thought: one concise sentence explaining the next move (no multi-step reasoning).
2) Action: a short imperative describing what to do.
3) A single <tool_call>...</tool_call> block containing only the JSON: {{"name": <function-name>, "arguments": <args-json-object>}}.

Rules:
- Output exactly in the order: Thought, Action, <tool_call>.
- Be brief: one sentence for Thought, one for Action.
- Do not output anything else outside those three parts.
- If finishing, use {tool_name} with action=terminate in the tool call.
- Never type passwords, PINs, card numbers or one-time codes, never solve a CAPTCHA, and never confirm a payment, a transfer or an order on your own: use action=hand_over before that step, with `text` saying what the user should do on the screen; they do it, tap Done, and you continue from the screen as they left it.
- Use action=ask_user only for an answer in words (a choice, a missing fact); use action=hand_over for a step done on the screen.
- Do only what the query asks: do not send, buy, delete or post anything it did not name.
- When the query asks for information, put everything you read that answers it (names, times, prices, seat numbers, order state) in action=answer, exactly as shown on the screen, before terminating.
- Write the Action sentence, and `text` for answer, ask_user and hand_over, in {language}: the Action sentence is shown to the user on the phone while you work.
