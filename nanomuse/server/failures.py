"""What to tell the person when a run dies on an exception.

A chat turn that fails used to surface as ``Something went wrong: APIError: Incorrect API
key provided …`` — the provider's words, about a key the person may never have seen (the
relay's). This module turns the exception into two things: a short **code** the apps can
act on (``allowance``, ``key``, ``network`` …) and one **English sentence** that says what
happened and where to go, which the web app translates with its own dictionary (the
sentence is the key, so the wording here must match ``web/src/i18n/zh-CN.ts``).
