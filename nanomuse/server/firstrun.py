"""The first conversation, the way the phones and the desktop do it (contract C4), for the
web app: the runtime owns the state, the web stays thin.

The setup pages end with Start, which binds the main chat as the first conversation. There
the app speaks first — three scripted lines, zero tokens, never in the model's history — and
asks what to call the person. From then on the model does the talking and reports what
happened in a small ``nanomuse-naming`` block at the end of its reply; the phase moves on
that block and on nothing else. A reply without one means the person talked about something
else, the model helped and steered back, and the phase stays.

Phases: ``none → ask_user_name → ask_agent_name → named → done``. The same words, name
pools and prompt as ``harness/dsh-nanomuse/src/firstrun.ts`` and
``onboarding/FirstConversation.kt``; the pure machine is here, :class:`MuseService`
applies it (the addendum for the bound thread only, ``after_turn`` when its reply ends).
