"""The always-on nanoMuse: threads, background workers, goals scheduler, ideas, profile.

This is the piece that keeps working after you close the app. It owns one
:class:`~nanomuse.app.NanoMuseApp` (LLM, tools, Sentinel, vault, memory, goals)
and runs one agent per *thread* — the main chat plus any side chats — so the
user can fire off several requests without waiting for the last one to finish.
