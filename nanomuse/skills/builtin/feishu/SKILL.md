# 飞书 (Feishu / Lark) through lark-cli

飞书 has an API, and `lark-cli` (the official CLI from Larksuite) wraps it; this is done with `shell`, not on the phone's screen. Every call prints JSON: `ok` says whether it worked, `data` holds the result, `error.message` says what went wrong. Read the JSON, never the user's screen.

## Is it there?

`shell`: `lark-cli auth status`; `identities.user.available` must be true for anything done in the user's name (their agenda, their messages). If the command is missing, the answer says `not_configured`, or the user identity is not logged in, say so in one line and stop; setting it up is the user's job, in two steps they run themselves: `lark-cli config init --new` once (it prints a link that creates the CLI's own 飞书 app under their account), then `lark-cli auth login` (a link or a QR code to approve; `--domain calendar,im,task` narrows what it may touch). Do not try to install it, to run `config init` or to log in for them. In a sandbox the CLI and its login only exist when the user shared them (`sandbox.share_read_only` / `sandbox.share` in config.toml); the error then says "command not found"; tell the user which two lines to add.

## Reading

- Today's schedule: `lark-cli calendar +agenda --as user` (a date: `--date 2026-09-25`; a range with `--start` / `--end`).
- Free time for a meeting: `lark-cli calendar +freebusy --user-ids ou_… --start … --end …`.
- A person: `lark-cli contact +search-user --query 张三 --as user` → their `open_id` (`ou_…`). A group: `lark-cli im +chat-search --query 项目群 --as user` → `chat_id` (`oc_…`). Take the one match; with several, ask the user which with one `ask_user`, do not guess.
- What was said: `lark-cli im +chat-messages-list --chat-id oc_… --as user` (a DM: `--user-id ou_…`; `--start-time` / `--end-time` for a window). `lark-cli im +messages-search --query 周报 --as user` across chats.
- Tasks: `lark-cli task +get-my-tasks --as user`. A document: `lark-cli docs +fetch --doc <url or token>` gives its text.
- Add `--jq '<expr>'` to keep the output small (`--jq '.data[] | {summary, start_time}'`), and `--format table` when you want to show a list to the user as is.

## Writing

Every write is something the user says to other people. Before the call, show the exact text and the recipient and ask with one `ask_user`; send only what they approved, word for word.

- A message: `lark-cli im +messages-send --chat-id oc_… --text "…" --as user` (a DM: `--user-id ou_…`; longer or formatted: `--markdown "…"`). Add `--idempotency-key <something unique>` so a retried command cannot send twice.
- A reply in a thread: `lark-cli im +messages-reply --message-id om_… --text "…" --as user`.
- An event: `lark-cli calendar +create --summary "…" --start 2026-09-25T14:00:00+08:00 --end 2026-09-25T15:00:00+08:00 --attendee-ids ou_a,ou_b --as user`.
- A task: `lark-cli task +create --summary "…" --due 2026-09-26 --assignee ou_… --as user`.
- A document: `lark-cli docs +create --title "…" --markdown @notes.md --as user` from a file in the workspace.

Commands the CLI marks *high-risk-write* (deleting an event, removing members, anything with `--yes`) refuse to run without `--yes`; add it only after the user has said yes to that very action, and never to a command that was not asked for. Sentinel will show the shell command on an approval card; that is expected.

## With the other hands

- 飞书 + 高德: plan the route or check the weather with the `amap` skill, then put the result in a message or an event description.
- 飞书 + the phone: apps that have no API (12306, 微信, 支付宝) are done with `phone_task`; the outcome (the train, the payment made) goes to the colleague through lark-cli.
- 飞书 + the workspace: a brief, a comparison, a page you wrote becomes a document with `docs +create` or an attachment with `im +messages-send --file`.

## Finish

Reply with what was read or done in a few lines: the messages sent (to whom, first words), the event (title, time, attendees), the task (title, due). Do not paste whole chat histories into the answer; give the gist and offer the rest. `remember` who the user writes to most and which groups matter, so that next time the search is shorter.
