"""Conversation sync (contracts C7 and C8): the runtime's chats are the same on every device
of the account.

The relay (``/v1/sync/*``, relay 0.19) keeps the text of the account's conversations —
user and final assistant messages, attachment names and sizes — and a change counter per
account. This engine:

* **pushes** the person's message the moment it is sent, the assistant's final text when
  the turn ends (debounced two seconds), a chat's title when it is created or renamed, a
  tombstone when it is deleted — and the **whole eligible history** of this runtime,
  oldest first in pages of 200, on sign-in and when sync is turned on again (every event
  is unmarked, so the first conversation goes up along with the rest);
* **pulls** on start, on sign-in, on the hub's ``sync`` frame and every 60 seconds, and
  applies what came in ``seq`` order: new conversations become threads (title, the device
  that started them), new messages become timeline events sorted into time order and
  history for the agent, tombstones remove messages and threads.

Every synced thread has a ``cid`` (kept in ``data_dir/sync.json`` next to the cursor);
every synced event carries a ``mid`` and ``synced: true`` in the timeline. The main chat
is ``kind: main`` and **one conversation for the whole account** (C8): the first device to
push it names its cid, every other device adopts that cid on its first pull (``main_exists``
says which when two race), and the local main chat shows the union of its own turns and the
other devices' — merged by ``created_at``, local first on a tie, deduplicated by ``mid``.
A pulled message this device wrote (the echo of its own push) is never added twice. Chats
addressed to another device (``Thread.device``) and chats another device opened here
(``Thread.remote_from``) are not synced — the other device has the same conversation as
its own.

**Main first** (C9, relay 0.20). By default only the main conversation syncs: pushes send
``kind: main`` alone and pulls ask for ``scope=main``. *Settings → Data controls → Also sync
side chats* (``side_chats`` here, default from ``[sync] side_chats``) turns the side chats
on for this device: they are pushed too, pulls ask for ``scope=all``, and the moment it is
turned on one pull from ``since=0&scope=all&tail=300`` brings the other devices' side chats
(idempotent by ``mid`` / ``cid``). Off again stops pushing and pulling them; what was synced
stays where it is. A fresh device's first pull asks for the **tail** — the newest 300
messages and their conversations — so the chat is on screen in seconds; older history stays
on the devices that wrote it. **Presence**: a turn that starts on a synced conversation
posts ``working: true`` to the relay right after the person's message went up, and
``working: false`` after the assistant's text; the hub's ``working`` frames from the other
devices land in a small map (:meth:`working_view`) the web app reads, and leave it when the
reply arrives, when the device says done, or ten minutes after ``at``. Presence is best
effort: never retried, never awaited on the turn's path, errors at debug.

**Whose conversations** (C10). Every local conversation that was ever pushed to, or pulled
from, an account carries that account's ``id`` (``GET /v1/me`` → ``account.id``) as its
``owner`` in ``sync.json``; one created while signed out and never synced has none. Signed
in as B, the list shows B's and the ownerless ones; A's stay on disk, hidden, and are never
pushed into B's account — an ownerless one becomes B's on its first push. Signed out,
everything local is shown. When the signed-in account changes, the account-scoped state
starts over: the cursor goes to 0 (a fresh ``tail`` pull), the presence map and the hub's
device list are cleared, and the main chat — one conversation per account on the relay — is
re-homed: the old account's main chat is kept as a hidden thread (``main_of``) and the new
account's own comes back when it has one, else a fresh one begins. Mappings are kept, so
switching back shows everything again. Sign-out alone clears nothing but the key.

Nothing here reaches the network when the account is signed out; ``sync_off`` from the
relay flips the local switch, ``bad_key`` pauses until the next sign-in."""
