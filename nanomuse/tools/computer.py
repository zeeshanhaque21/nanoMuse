"""Operating this computer's screen: ``computer_screen``, ``computer_act`` and
``computer_task`` — the phone's three tools with a mouse and a keyboard under them.

They exist only while the hands are turned on (``[hands] enabled``, the switch in the app),
and they are the last rung: a command in the shell, a file, a web page or a skill that does
the thing exactly comes first; the screen is for what has no other door — a desktop app, a
dialog, a page that will not load without a real browser session.

Risk is judged like the phone's: looking is safe but private; a click is *moderate* until
the words under the cursor say pay, transfer, send, delete, confirm — then it is *sensitive*
and asked every time. Every pointed action carries a ``label`` (the words on the button or
field, as the screenshot shows them); the window in front is the *target* of a standing
approval, so "always allow in Terminal" never covers the bank's site in a browser.

Applications are asked for one by one: the first action in an application in a conversation
asks "Let <Muse> use <App>?" (once, this conversation, always — a ``computer_app:<id>``
grant the Permissions page lists). On macOS the hands can work in one application's window
(``[hands] mode``, :mod:`nanomuse.computer.mac_window`): ``computer_target`` names it, or
``app`` on any ``computer_act`` call; the screenshot the model sees is then that window and
the person keeps the cursor.
