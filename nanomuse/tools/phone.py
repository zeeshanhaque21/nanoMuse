"""Operating the phone: ``phone_screen``, ``phone_act`` and ``phone_task``.

These exist only while GUI operation is turned on (``[gui] enabled``, the switch in the app)
— that is the user's choice, made once, not the model's. They talk to whatever phone is
connected through :class:`~nanomuse.phone.PhoneLink`: the Android app's accessibility
service, or the MobileGym module. The phone is seen through screenshots only and operated
by coordinates, so the same three tools work on any app, on the real phone and in the demo.

Risk: looking at the screen is safe but exposes private data (what is on someone's phone
is theirs), so it taints the session like reading mail does. Acting is *moderate* — tapping
around is reversible — until what the finger is on says payment, transfer, send, delete,
order: then the call is *sensitive* with a warning, which means the Sentinel asks every time
and no standing approval covers it (``gui.sensitive_words``). Since no element tree names
what is under the finger, every tap carries a ``label`` — the words of the button or field
as read from the screenshot — and that is what is assessed and logged.
