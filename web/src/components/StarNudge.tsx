 * The ask for a star, at the moments it is fair to make it — and the relay says which
 * (contract C1, `GET /api/nudges`): the account page the first time it is seen signed in,
 * after the 3rd, 10th and 30th task, after a face is drawn, when the allowance is used up,
 * on the 7th and 30th day the app was opened, when a goal is marked done. A cooldown between
 * asks and a lifetime cap, both from the policy; going to GitHub from any of them ends them
 * all. A card where the moment is, never a dialog — and the tone is a thank you, not a bill.
